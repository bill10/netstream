Our experiments are designed to characterize the gut microbiota of the arctic ground squirrel; an animal that naturally pushes the known limits of mammalian physiology; with the goal of understanding the relationship between the gut microflora and host physiology. In particular; the arctic ground squirrel annually undergoes a discrete period of profound fattening in preparation for hibernation that provides an excellent platform upon which to investigate interrelationships between gut microbiota and obesity; therefore; our studies will contribute to the understanding of the complex interactions between the gut microbial community and human disease.            ,NIGMS,8289978,9-Mar-12,PA-10-070,1R15GM098938-01A1,1,R15,GM,98938,1,A1,"SLEDJESKI, DARREN D.",1-Apr-12,31-Mar-16,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-DKUS-C (90)),,10499602,"DUDDLESTON, KHRYSTYNE ",Not Applicable,At-Large,BIOLOGY,76664986,US,61.189847,-149.818764,UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA ANCHORAGE,ANCHORAGE,AK,SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES,99508-4614,UNITED STATES, ,1-Apr-12,31-Mar-16,859,Research Projects,2012,NIGMS,200000,84412,284412,

Recent studies indicate that the number ofmicrobial species involved in lung infection in CF (the CF lung microbiota) is much larger and morecomplex than previously believed. Nevertheless; currently little is known about how the structure ofthe lung microbiota (i.e.; the precise types of species present and the relative abundance of each) orchanges in this structure influence the progression of lung disease in CF. The long-term objective ofthis project is to understand the relationship between the lung microbiota and the progression of lungdisease in persons with CF.,NHLBI,7829335,18-Sep-09,RFA-OD-09-003,1RC1HL100809-01,1,RC1,HL,100809,1,,"BANKS-SCHLEGEL, SUSAN P",1-Sep-09,31-Aug-11,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-CVRS-B (58)),,1970088,"LIPUMA, JOHN J ","LI, JUN ;YOUNG, VINCENT B",12,NONE,73133571,US,42.244005,-83.73915,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,ANN ARBOR,MI,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,48109-1276,UNITED STATES,YES,1-Sep-09,31-Aug-10,701,Research Projects,2009,OD,,,499999,

Recent studies indicate that the number ofmicrobial species involved in lung infection in CF (the CF lung microbiota) is much larger and morecomplex than previously believed. Nevertheless; currently little is known about how the structure ofthe lung microbiota (i.e.; the precise types of species present and the relative abundance of each) orchanges in this structure influence the progression of lung disease in CF. The long-term objective ofthis project is to understand the relationship between the lung microbiota and the progression of lungdisease in persons with CF.,NHLBI,7935321,2-Aug-10,RFA-OD-09-003,5RC1HL100809-02,5,RC1,HL,100809,2,,"BANKS-SCHLEGEL, SUSAN P",1-Sep-09,31-Aug-12,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-CVRS-B (58)),,1970088,"LIPUMA, JOHN J ","LI, JUN ;YOUNG, VINCENT B",12,GENETICS,73133571,US,42.244005,-83.73915,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,ANN ARBOR,MI,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,48109-1276,UNITED STATES,YES,1-Sep-10,31-Aug-12,701,Research Projects,2010,OD,,,498814,

Most complicated urinary tract infections that occur in hospitals are due to Proteus mirabilis infections. And the nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae causes children's ear infections and exacerbates lung diseases; especially in the developing world. In both of these pathogens; the LpoA protein is essential for growth or virulence; and stimulating bacterial cell wall synthesis. The proposed research will determine three-dimensional structures of LpoA bound to the enzyme MrcA to understand how the complex activates cell wall synthesis. Although MrcA is the target for penicillin-like drugs; finding molecules that block LpoA binding will be complementary and perhaps less susceptible to drug resistance.         ,NIAID,8285419,20-Jan-12,PA-10-069,1R21AI099984-01,1,R21,AI,99984,1,,"KORPELA, JUKKA K.",1-Feb-12,31-Jan-14,Prokaryotic Cell and Molecular Biology Study Section (PCMB) ,,1866126,"SAPER, MARK A",Not Applicable,12,BIOCHEMISTRY,73133571,US,42.244005,-83.73915,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,ANN ARBOR,MI,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,48109-1276,UNITED STATES, ,1-Feb-12,31-Jan-13,855,Research Projects,2012,NIAID,153225,78380,231605,

Most complicated urinary tract infections that occur in hospitals are due to Proteus mirabilis infections. And the nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae causes children's ear infections and exacerbates lung diseases; especially in the developing world. In both of these pathogens; the LpoA protein is essential for growth or virulence; and stimulating bacterial cell wall synthesis. The proposed research will determine three-dimensional structures of LpoA bound to the enzyme MrcA to understand how the complex activates cell wall synthesis.

It is expected that the biosynthetic technology developed in this program will be transferred to biotech company(s); and GMP processes will be developed to produce the oligosaccharides in quantities large enough for preclinical studies of tolerance and safety; as well as for safety; dose-ranging; and efficacy trials in infants and children who are at high risk for exposure to gastrointestinal pathogens.,NICHD,8514952,26-Jul-13,RFA-HD-08-004,5R01HD061935-06,5,R01,HD,61935,6,,"GRAVE, GILMAN D.",15-Sep-09,31-Jul-14,Special Emphasis Panel (ZHD1-DSR-Z (04)),,6270869,"WANG, PENG GEORGE",Not Applicable,5,NONE,837322494,US,33.762977,-84.42296,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,ATLANTA,GA,ORGANIZED RESEARCH UNITS,30302-3999,UNITED STATES, ,1-Aug-13,31-Jul-14,865,Research Projects,2013,NICHD,202934,90306,293240,

Gut integrity is markedly dysregulated following sepsis with significant alterations in cell production; loss; migration and permeability as well as altered communication between the gut epithelium and the adaptive immune system. Understanding mechanisms through which gut integrity is dysregulated in sepsis has significant public health implications in a disease that iscommon; very costly; and highly lethal.         ,NIGMS,8760660,19-Aug-14,PA-13-302,2R01GM072808-10,2,R01,GM,72808,10,,"SOMERS, SCOTT D.",6-Sep-05,31-Aug-18,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-SBIB-V (02)),,8050254,"COOPERSMITH, CRAIG M.",Not Applicable,5,SURGERY,66469933,US,33.762977,-84.42296,EMORY UNIVERSITY,ATLANTA,GA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,30322-4250,UNITED STATES, ,1-Sep-14,31-Aug-15,859,Research Projects,2014,NIGMS,200000,112000,312000,

Patients with severe COPD are at risk of getting worse and acquiring viraland bacterial infections.

Rapidlyadvancing DNA sequencing capabilities have altered profoundly the volume of sequence data that can beprocessed in a study. However several bottlenecks to the analysis of this DNA sequence data must beovercome as the scale of studies expands. These include several issues concerned with the quality assuranceof primary DNA sequence data; as well as interpretation of results drawn from these data; for instance theaccuracy of identifying microorganisms in a specimen based solely on DNA sequence. In this project; wepropose to build a software infrastructure based on a high-precision DNA sequence analysis tool (INFERNAL);that addresses many of the critical barriers to progress currently facing researchers in the metagenomics field. In this two-year project; the base software technology; developed by Prof. Eddy (Co-Investigator) andcolleagues to identify and annotate RNA genes in genomes; will be adapted to the needs of the metagenomicscommunity through joint development by the Pace and Eddy groups. This research team will use theirextensive backgrounds in RNA structural biology; molecular-evolution; and computational biology to build andvalidate software tools that extend the basic feature set of INFERNAL; with special emphasis on facilitatingresearch carried out in the NIH Human Microbiome Project.1,NHGRI,8149989,20-Sep-11,RFA-RM-09-021,7R21HG005964-02,7,R21,HG,5964,2,,"PROCTOR, LITA ",27-Sep-10,30-Jun-14,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-GGG-N (50)),,9866279,"FRANK, DANIEL ",Not Applicable,6,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,41096314,US,39.708143,-104.724958,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,AURORA,CO,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,80045-2570,UNITED STATES, ,1-Jul-11,30-Jun-14,310,Research Projects,2011,OD,,,228750,

Recent studies indicate that postmenopausal women exhibit elevated abundances of immune cells (certain T-lymphocytes) that are susceptible to HIV-1 infection; however; why this occurs is not known. We hypothesize those changes in cervicovaginal bacteria increase the quantities of these HIV-1 susceptible T-lymphocytes in the cervix; and thereby increase the risk of heterosexual transmission of HIV-1 to females. Through observational studies of well-defined human populations; we will test this hypothesis by using high-throughput DNA sequencing methods; along with advanced microscopy; to comprehensively determine whether menopause results in 1) different kinds of bacteria inhabiting the female reproductive tract; 2) expression of different bacterial genes; and/or 3) modification of cervical gene expression.         ,NIAID,8317886,10-Apr-12,PA-11-262,1R03AI102836-01,1,R03,AI,102836,1,,"TURPIN, JIM A.",15-Apr-12,31-Mar-14,Special Emphasis Panel (ZHD1-DSR-W (50)),,9866279,"FRANK, DANIEL ",Not Applicable,6,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,41096314,US,39.708143,-104.724958,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,AURORA,CO,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,80045-2570,UNITED STATES, ,15-Apr-12,31-Mar-14,855,Research Projects,2012,NIAID,50000,26916,76916,

Patients with severe COPD are at risk of getting worse and being infected by viruses and bacteria. These are called exacerbations; which cause patients to be hospitalized and received antibiotics and drugs that suppress the immune system. These patients are then at a significantly increased risk of death and marked clinical worsening of the shortness of breath. The proposed study is a novel way to find out whether there are bacteria present in small airway tubes in patients with COPD. We propose to use the lung tissues collected by the LTRC and translate a novel and quite cool"" method to perform a large scale screen of the bacteria that may be present in normal and diseased lungs. Our preliminary studies have revealed that the lungs of patients with COPD and also smokers with mild or no disease have bacteria called Novosphingobium. This bacteria is usually found in soil and water; however; it has been linked to an auto-immune destruction of the liver called primary biliary cirrhosis. Furthermore; Novosphingobium can digest substances present in the tobacco. Our proposal seeks to quantify these bacteria in lung samples in which the DNA has been selectively extracted from particular lung regions. Moreover; we also propose to initiate studies to show how the infection by Novosphingobium can accelerate damage of lung cells by inflammatory cells.

It is known that alcohol causes intestinal bacterial overgrowth and hyper-permeability; resulting in endotoxemia that plays a critical role in alcohol-induced injury t the liver and other tissues.

Patients with severe COPD are at risk of getting worse and being infected by viruses and bacteria. These are called exacerbations; which cause patients to be hospitalized and received antibiotics and drugs that suppress the immune system. These patients are then at a significantly increased risk of death and marked clinical worsening of the shortness of breath. The proposed study is a novel way to find out whether there are bacteria present in small airway tubes in patients with COPD. We propose to use the lung tissues collected by the LTRC and translate a novel and quite cool"" method to perform a large scale screen of the bacteria that may be present in normal and diseased lungs. Our preliminary studies have revealed that the lungs of patients with COPD and also smokers with mild or no disease have bacteria called Novosphingobium. This bacteria is usually found in soil and water; however; it has been linked to an auto-immune destruction of the liver called primary biliary cirrhosis. Furthermore; Novosphingobium can digest substances present in the tobacco. Our proposal seeks to quantify these bacteria in lung samples in which the DNA has been selectively extracted from particular lung regions. Moreover; we also propose to initiate studies to show how the infection by Novosphingobium can accelerate damage of lung cells by inflammatory cells.

The findings from this project will explore the lung asan originating site of autoimmunity in RA; as well as characterize lung bacterial associations thatmay be mechanisms by which this process occurs. While we realize that this project is correlative; these findings can change the current paradigm of our understanding of the pathogenesis of RA. After these relationships have been explored; they will provide a strong foundation for additional mechanistic studies of RA development that will move us closer to understanding the pathogenesis of RA as well as designing effective prevention strategies for this disease. Specifically; identifying the lung as a site where RA originates; as well as identifying specific bacterial communities that directly influence the initiation of RA in the lung can lead to future therapies that are directed at specific mechanisms of RA development at the site of initiation (e.g. the lung); and these therapies could be utilized for novel treatments and/r prevention of RA. This project will also serve as an outstanding program for Dr. Demoruelle's independent career development. The project will establish key findings to support future independent projects in which she will evaluate specific immunologic mechanisms that generate RA-related autoimmunity in the lung; identify mechanisms by which RA-related autoantibodies can be initially generated in the lung and later transition to the joints; and explore other mucosa sites that may also be involved in the etiology of RA.            ,NIAMS,8764655,26-Jun-14,PA-11-194,1K23AR066712-01,1,K23,AR,66712,1,,"MAO, SU-YAU ",1-Sep-14,31-Aug-19,Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases Special Grants Review Committee (AMS) ,,10913088,"DEMORUELLE, MARY KRISTEN",Not Applicable,6,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,41096314,US,39.708143,-104.724958,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,AURORA,CO,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,80045-2570,UNITED STATES, ,1-Sep-14,31-Aug-15,846,Other Research-Related,2014,NIAMS,121750,9740,131490,

The aims of this randomized clinical trial are to compare the effects of an 8- wk. isocaloric higher complex carbohydrate/lower fat diet vs. a conventional lower carbohydrate (higher fat) diet on glycemic and lipid profiles; maternal insulin resistance; placenta nutrient transporters; the maternal microbiome; neonatal intrahepatic fat; and neonatal total adiposity (primary outcome). We will then follow the infants for 1-yr and measure maternal breast milk and infant microbiome composition to observe if they impact net fat mass gain differently in infants exposed to one diet vs. the other. Identifying a diet for GDM women that can effectively alter maternal/fetal metabolism is critical to reducing short- and long-term metabolic risk in thisgrowing cohort of mothers and infants and has the potential to be applicable to overweight/obese pregnant women.         ,NIDDK,8817163,10-Sep-14,PA-13-302,1R01DK101659-01A1,1,R01,DK,101659,1,A1,"SILVA, CORINNE M",15-Sep-14,31-Jul-19,Clinical and Integrative Diabetes and Obesity Study Section (CIDO) ,,8529321,"HERNANDEZ, TERI ",Not Applicable,6,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,41096314,US,39.708143,-104.724958,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,AURORA,CO,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,80045-2570,UNITED STATES, ,15-Sep-14,31-Jul-15,847,Research Projects,2014,NIDDK,414200,211955,626155,

Recent findings indicate that maternal gut micro biota during pregnancy may contribute to obesity-related phenotypes including elevated blood insulin; inflammation; and fat deposition. The studies outlined in this proposal will investigate 1 how obesity impacts the maternal microbiome during late pregnancy and through the first 4 months postpartum; 2) how infant exposure to the maternal microbiome among women with obesity affects the infant microbiome during the first 4 months of life; and finally 3) whether thematernal-infant microbiome is a major determinants of infant adiposity through the first 4 months of life. The results of this project will provide a deeper understanding of how maternal obesity act to reprogram the microbiome in mother-infant pairs and help to dissect the mechanisms linking maternal characteristics to infant adiposity through changes to the human microbiome.      ,NIDDK,8718901,12-Mar-14,PA-11-113,1F32DK101179-01A1,1,F32,DK,101179,1,A1,"CASTLE, ARTHUR ",1-May-14,30-Apr-16,Special Emphasis Panel (ZDK1-GRB-R (J1)),,10438125,"LEMAS, DOMINICK JOSEPH",Not Applicable,6,PEDIATRICS,41096314,US,39.708143,-104.724958,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,AURORA,CO,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,80045-2570,UNITED STATES, ,1-May-14,30-Apr-15,847,Training; Individual,2014,NIDDK,52368,,52368,

This study will assess how viral infection; bacterial populations; and the balance between host immune activation and immune suppression interact to determine whether a given patient develops VAP. Understanding how these critical interactions are involved in the pathogenesis of VAP will improve public health by identifying targets for more effective prevention and treatment strategies that will decrease the burden of VAP.         ,NHLBI,8764528,31-Aug-14,PA-13-302,1R01HL124103-01,1,R01,HL,124103,1,,"CALER, ELISABET V",1-Sep-14,31-May-18,"Infectious Diseases, Reproductive Health, Asthma and Pulmonary Conditions Study Section (IRAP) ",,8145288,"MOURANI, PETER M ","SONTAG, MARCI K",6,PEDIATRICS,41096314,US,39.708143,-104.724958,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,AURORA,CO,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,80045-2570,UNITED STATES, ,1-Sep-14,31-May-15,837,Research Projects,2014,NHLBI,550621,218284,768905,

Pulmonary exacerbations; episodic increases in respiratory symptoms; are a serious problem in CF and frequently require prolonged hospitalizations; cause worsening lung damage and decrease quality of life. By using advanced microbiologic techniques and measuring inflammatory and clinical response to therapy; we hope to identify targets for improved treatments. Improving treatments for pulmonary exacerbations may allow people with CF to live longer and have a better quality of life; stated goals of the NIH NHLBI.         ,NHLBI,8635582,26-Dec-13,PA-11-194,1K23HL114883-01A1,1,K23,HL,114883,1,A1,"TIGNO, XENIA ",1-Jan-14,31-Dec-17,Special Emphasis Panel (ZHL1-CSR-X (O1)),,8493032,"ZEMANICK, EDITH TOWLER",Not Applicable,6,PEDIATRICS,41096314,US,39.708143,-104.724958,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,AURORA,CO,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,80045-2570,UNITED STATES, ,1-Jan-14,31-Dec-14,837,Other Research-Related,2014,NHLBI,126750,10140,136890,

The proposed study will assess the utility of an easily collected biomarker of leaky intestine called zonulin to monitor intestinal permeability (leakiness); and provide information on the safety and acceptability of administering a probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) to VLBW infants; the optimal dose of LGG to improve the leaky intestine; and the impact of LGG on the balance between bad bacteria"" and ""beneficial bacteria"" in the intestine.

Over 300 million women worldwide use HC; so knowledge gained from identifying which women are likely to benefit from HC use and the type of HC that would provide the most benefit will help optimize the use of HC in women. Moreover; understanding how sex hormones influence immune responses would allow us to explore the possibility of harnessing these agents to maximize mucosal and systemic immune responses to vaccines.        ,NIAID,8108059,10-Feb-11,PA-10-067,1R01AI089878-01A1,1,R01,AI,89878,1,A1,"DAVID, HAGIT S.",1-Mar-11,29-Feb-16,"Infectious Diseases, Reproductive Health, Asthma and Pulmonary Conditions Study Section (IRAP) ",,7565729,"GHANEM, KHALIL G",Not Applicable,7,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,1910777,US,39.329164,-76.617855,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,BALTIMORE,MD,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,21205-1832,UNITED STATES, ,1-Mar-11,29-Feb-12,855,Research Projects,2011,NIAID,,,467529,

Aswith all new technologies; it is critical that an interdisciplinary discussion of possible productrisks and appropriate regulation take place before uptake of the new technology makes it tooburdensome or unrealistic to impose a new regulatory structure on the new technology. Thisproject will explore the current state of probiotics research and identify current and potential usesof probiotics in consumer products and clinical applications. The Investigators will bringtogether experts in the area of health policy; human microbiome science; and food and drugregulation to discuss the adequacy of the current regulatory frameworks and any potentialalternatives in order to provide policy makers with regulatory options designed to protect thepublic from misleading claims or any potential risks that might derive from the use of probioticproducts.,NHGRI,8116493,24-Jun-11,RFA-RM-08-030,5R01HG005171-03,5,R01,HG,5171,3,,"MCEWEN, JEAN ",4-Sep-09,30-Jun-14,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-GGG-E (52)),,9353117,"HOFFMANN, DIANE E.",Not Applicable,7,MISCELLANEOUS,188435911,US,39.291412,-76.624753,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,BALTIMORE,MD,OTHER DOMESTIC HIGHER EDUCATION,21201-1508,UNITED STATES, ,1-Jul-11,30-Jun-14,172,Research Projects,2011,NHGRI,,,176344,

Unfortunately; only a minority of women (~30 percent) have healthy vaginal lactobacilli; while about 1 in 3 women have BV at any given time. This project will help reveal how healthy lactobacilli are displaced by BV-associated bacteria; and will likely support development of methods to prevent BV and thereby reduce STIs.         ,NIAID,8397950,27-Apr-12,PA-11-113,1F32AI102535-01,1,F32,AI,102535,1,,"DAVID, HAGIT S.",27-Apr-12,26-Apr-14,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-F13-C (20)),,11196836,"WANG, YING-YING ",Not Applicable,7,PHYSIOLOGY,1910777,US,39.329164,-76.617855,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,BALTIMORE,MD,SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES,21205-1832,UNITED STATES, ,27-Apr-12,26-Apr-13,855,Training; Individual,2012,NIAID,49214,,49214,

Over 300 million women worldwide use HC; so knowledge gained from identifying which women are likely to benefit from HC use and the type of HC that would provide the most benefit will help optimize the use of HC in women. Moreover; understanding how sex hormones influence immune responses would allow us to explore the possibility of harnessing these agents to maximize mucosal and systemic immune responses to vaccines.        ,NIAID,8442373,23-Jan-13,PA-10-067,5R01AI089878-03,5,R01,AI,89878,3,,"DAVID, HAGIT S.",1-Mar-11,29-Feb-16,"Infectious Diseases, Reproductive Health, Asthma and Pulmonary Conditions Study Section (IRAP) ",,7565729,"GHANEM, KHALIL G",Not Applicable,7,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,1910777,US,39.329164,-76.617855,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,BALTIMORE,MD,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,21205-1832,UNITED STATES, ,1-Mar-13,28-Feb-14,855,Research Projects,2013,NIAID,503685,198835,702520,

This research is relevant to the NIH mission as it ultimately aims at promoting health; reducing risk to unintended adverse sequelae of sexually transmitted disease (STI) and improving the quality of life for men and women who are at risk of STIs.      Project 1: Human Genetic Variance and Cellular Responses to Sexually Transmitted Infections   Project Leader: Dennis Ko       DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Damage to reproductive organs as a result of inflammatory responses to STIs can lead to severe complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease; ectopic pregnancy and infertility. Multiple environmental factors including the infecting strain; dose and frequency of infections; and composition of the microbial communities in the urogenital tract contribute to the severity of disease manifestation and ensuing sequelae. Similarly; co-infection with other sexually transmitted pathogens may act synergistically to worsen disease. Finally; host genetics likely plays an important role in susceptibility to infectio and ensuing immunopathologies. This project will address the role played by human genetic polymorphisms that regulate cellular interactions and responses to C. trachomatis alone or in the context of N. gonorrhoeae and vaginal microbiota components. We will identify and characterize genetic variants that affect STIs by applying two parallel and complementary approaches. First; we will use a discovery platform for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of cellular traits called Hi-HOST (high throughput human in vitro susceptibility testing). Hi-HOST combines precise measurement of phenotypes in cells derived from hundreds of normal; genotyped individuals with genome-wide association to identify genetic differences that underlie the phenotypic variation. Furthermore; we propose to extend the Hi-HOST framework to examine how co-infection and the microbiota can act synergistically or antagonistically on the immune response and how human genetic differences can modulate these effects. Second; we will carry out GWAS of clinical traits and outcomes using the STING cohort. This dual approach will allow for study of human genetic variation in both the controlled experimental setting of identical infections with Hi-HOST and the more clinically relevant but complex setting of patients. We predict that overlap of SNPs identified by Hi-HOST and GWAS of the STING cohort will highlight human variation affecting both cellular infection phenotypes and clinical phenotypes and outcomes. Thus; we will determine not only which human genetic variants are associated with susceptibility to STIs but also intermediate phenotypes (such as cytokine levels; miRNA; and microbiota composition) that are likely responsible for the altered physiology. This will facilitate identification of biomarkers and possible drug targets; as well as specific geneticpopulations that might benefit most from targeted therapies.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The identification of human genetic variants that contribute to the host/STI pathogen/microbiome interactions will provide a fundamental understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying susceptibility to infection and ensuing risks to immunopathologies. Furthermore; these genetic variants will provide novel biomarkers to identify individuals at greatest risk to infection; recurrence and disease; such that appropriate therapies are applied. This research is relevant to NIH mission of promoting health by reducing risk to unintended adverse consequences of STI and improving the quality of life for men and women who are at risk.         ,NIAID,8769302,15-Jul-14,RFA-AI-13-043,2U19AI084044-06,2,U19,AI,84044,6,,"DAVID, HAGIT S.",21-Sep-09,31-Aug-19,Special Emphasis Panel (ZAI1-MFH-M (M1)),,1969602,"BAVOIL, PATRIK M ","RAVEL, JACQUES ",7,MICROBIOLOGY/IMMUN/VIROLOGY,188435911,US,39.291412,-76.624753,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,BALTIMORE,MD,SCHOOLS OF DENTISTRY,21201-1508,UNITED STATES, ,1-Sep-14,31-Aug-15,855,Research Projects,2014,NIAID,1952858,832067,2479885,

Over 300 million women worldwide use HC; so knowledge gained from identifying which women are likely to benefit from HC use and the type of HC that would provide the most benefit will help optimize the use of HC in women. Moreover; understanding how sex hormones influence immune responses would allow us to explore the possibility of harnessing these agents to maximize mucosal and systemic immune responses to vaccines.        ,NIAID,8607111,17-Jan-14,PA-10-067,5R01AI089878-04,5,R01,AI,89878,4,,"DAVID, HAGIT S.",1-Mar-11,29-Feb-16,"Infectious Diseases, Reproductive Health, Asthma and Pulmonary Conditions Study Section (IRAP) ",,7565729,"GHANEM, KHALIL G",Not Applicable,7,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,1910777,US,39.329164,-76.617855,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,BALTIMORE,MD,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,21205-1832,UNITED STATES, ,1-Mar-14,28-Feb-15,855,Research Projects,2014,NIAID,542950,212465,755415,

The goal of this project is to characterize the normal flora of MRSA- colonized veterans before and after decolonization with intranasal mupirocin and topical chlorhexidine. Our long term goal is to use the information gained to develop new ways to manipulate the human microbiome to reduce the risk of MRSA infections.""",VA,8698376,24-Jan-14,RFA-CX-11-001,5I01CX000491-03,5,I01,VA,491,3,,Unavailable,1-Apr-12,31-Mar-16,Infectious Diseases B (INFB) ,,2873560,"ROGHMANN, MARY-CLAIRE ",Not Applicable,7,Unavailable,796532609,US,39.289314,-76.623792,BALTIMORE VA MEDICAL CENTER,BALTIMORE,MD,Unavailable,21201-1524,UNITED STATES, ,1-Apr-14,31-Mar-15,999,Research Projects,2014,,,,,

This topic is highly relevant to several human diseases. Alterations in blood glucose levels are the foremost manifestation of Type-2 diabetes; a disease of epidemic proportion in our society. In addition; recent exciting results indicate that uncontrolled cell proliferation; which leads to diseases such as cancer; is highly dependent on glucose metabolism. There has been major progress in new approaches to understand glucose transport and metabolism; using large databases and computer-intensive methods. This conference bring together researchers with expertise in glucose transport; metabolism and systems biology; and their interactions are likely to result in new ideas for research and therapies in this important area of human health.

Given that ER stress is readilydemonstrable in animal models of IBD and the human condition; and that the XBP1 gene harborspolymorphisms that confer risk for the development of IBD; we propose that the host's ability to manage ERstress within the IEC that is caused by environmental factors including inflammation itself is an important issuein understanding IBD pathogenesis.

Given that ER stress is readilydemonstrable in animal models of IBD and the human condition; and that the XBP1 gene harborspolymorphisms that confer risk for the development of IBD; we propose that the host's ability to manage ERstress within the IEC that is caused by environmental factors including inflammation itself is an important issuein understanding IBD pathogenesis. These animal models and their interrogation provide a unique opportunityto identify and test novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment and prevention of IBD that may be generallyextensible to IBD patients with a wide-range of phenotypic and genetic pedigrees.,NIDDK,8064351,9-Jun-11,PA-07-070,5R01DK088199-02,5,R01,DK,88199,2,,"HAMILTON, FRANK A",1-May-10,30-Apr-15,Gastrointestinal Mucosal Pathobiology Study Section (GMPB) ,,1877240,"BLUMBERG, RICHARD S.",Not Applicable,7,Unavailable,30811269,US,42.334978,-71.105987,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,BOSTON,MA,Unavailable,02115-6110,UNITED STATES, ,1-May-11,30-Apr-12,847,Research Projects,2011,NIDDK,,,559634,

Bacteroides spp. are extremely important commensals that have sphingolipids in their membranes; a rare occurrence in bacterial species. In this grant we will determine whether these microbes survive and withstand the stress of the intestinal environment through a sphingolipid/cholesterol mediated signaling pathway otherwise only found in eukaryotic cells.      ,NIAID,8046848,15-Dec-10,PA-10-069,1R21AI090102-01A1,1,R21,AI,90102,1,A1,"KORPELA, JUKKA K.",15-Dec-10,30-Nov-12,Gastrointestinal Mucosal Pathobiology Study Section (GMPB) ,,1870456,"KASPER, DENNIS L.",Not Applicable,7,Unavailable,30811269,US,42.334978,-71.105987,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,BOSTON,MA,Unavailable,02115-6110,UNITED STATES, ,15-Dec-10,30-Nov-11,855,Research Projects,2011,NIAID,,,255413,

Given that ER stress is readilydemonstrable in animal models of IBD and the human condition; and that the XBP1 gene harborspolymorphisms that confer risk for the development of IBD; we propose that the host's ability to manage ERstress within the IEC that is caused by environmental factors including inflammation itself is an important issuein understanding IBD pathogenesis.

We have observed that bacteria can mediate gene silencing in mammalian cells (a process termed transkingdom RNAi); and have recently designed a transkingdom gene silencing therapy for familial adenatomous polyposis (FAP) which has been cleared by the FDA for phase Ia/II clinical trials; and is based on oral administration of bacteria capable of inducing RNAi against beta-catenin. To support and enhance the clinical development of this approach; the studies outlined in this proposal will elucidate the mechanism of bacteria-mediated RNAi; identify biomarkers for clinical development; and develop a next generation transkingdom gene silencing technology to further improve the long-term efficacy and safety of using non- pathogenic or probiotic bacteria to treat a broad spectrum of human diseases.            ,NIGMS,8342433,20-Jul-12,PA-10-067,1R01GM102246-01,1,R01,GM,102246,1,,"BENDER, MICHAEL T.",1-Aug-12,30-Apr-17,Therapeutic Approaches to Genetic Diseases (TAG) ,,9087756,"LI, CHIANG JIA",Not Applicable,7,Unavailable,71723621,US,42.346758,-71.10256,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,BOSTON,MA,Unavailable,02215-5400,UNITED STATES, ,1-Aug-12,30-Apr-13,859,Research Projects,2012,NIGMS,190000,140600,330600,

Given that ER stress is readily demonstrable in animal models of IBD and the human condition; and that the XBP1 gene harbors polymorphisms that confer risk for the development of IBD; we propose that the host's ability to manage ER stress within the IEC that is caused by environmental factors including inflammation itself is an important issue in understanding IBD pathogenesis. These animal models and their interrogation provide a unique opportunity to identify and test novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment and prevention of IBD that may be generally extensible to IBD patients with a wide-range of phenotypic and genetic pedigrees.      ,NIDDK,8465875,17-May-13,PA-07-070,5R01DK088199-04,5,R01,DK,88199,4,,"GREY, MICHAEL J",1-May-10,30-Apr-15,Gastrointestinal Mucosal Pathobiology Study Section (GMPB) ,,1877240,"BLUMBERG, RICHARD S.",Not Applicable,7,Unavailable,30811269,US,42.334978,-71.105987,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,BOSTON,MA,Unavailable,02115-6110,UNITED STATES, ,1-May-13,30-Apr-14,847,Research Projects,2013,NIDDK,348188,163169,511357,

We have observed that bacteria can mediate gene silencing in mammalian cells (a process termed transkingdom RNAi); and have recently designed a transkingdom gene silencing therapy for familial adenatomous polyposis (FAP) which has been cleared by the FDA for phase Ia/II clinical trials; and is based on oral administration of bacteria capable of inducing RNAi against beta-catenin. To support and enhance the clinical development of this approach; the studies outlined in this proposal will elucidate the mechanism of bacteria-mediated RNAi; identify biomarkers for clinical development; and develop a next generation transkingdom gene silencing technology to further improve the long-term efficacy and safety of using non- pathogenic or probiotic bacteria to treat a broad spectrum of human diseases.            ,NIGMS,8514647,30-Apr-13,PA-10-067,5R01GM102246-02,5,R01,GM,102246,2,,"BENDER, MICHAEL T.",1-Aug-12,30-Apr-17,Therapeutic Approaches to Genetic Diseases (TAG) ,,9087756,"LI, CHIANG JIA",Not Applicable,7,Unavailable,71723621,US,42.346758,-71.10256,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,BOSTON,MA,Unavailable,02215-5400,UNITED STATES, ,1-May-13,30-Apr-14,859,Research Projects,2013,NIGMS,183350,135679,319029,

The proposed research seeks to identify alterations to the host microbiome and new microbial pathogens (bacteria; fungi and viruses) in post- HSCT illnesses through the use of modern genomic techniques; we have demonstrated preliminary success in this approach; having recently identified a candidate pathogen in a previously idiopathic post-HSCT colitis syndrome.         ,NCI,8679505,29-Aug-14,PA-11-193,1K08CA184420-01,1,K08,CA,184420,1,,"LIM, SUSAN E",1-Sep-14,2-Sep-14,Subcommittee G - Education (NCI) ,,10995633,"BHATT, AMI SIDDHARTH",Not Applicable,7,Unavailable,76580745,US,42.337844,-71.108337,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,BOSTON,MA,Unavailable,02215-5450,UNITED STATES, ,1-Sep-14,2-Sep-14,398,Other Research-Related,2014,NCI,3400,272,3672,

Given that ER stress is readily demonstrable in animal models of IBD and the human condition; and that the XBP1 gene harbors polymorphisms that confer risk for the development of IBD; we propose that the host's ability to manage ER stress within the IEC that is caused by environmental factors including inflammation itself is an important issue in understanding IBD pathogenesis. These animal models and their interrogation provide a unique opportunity to identify and test novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment and prevention of IBD that may be generally extensible to IBD patients with a wide-range of phenotypic and genetic pedigrees.      ,NIDDK,8663242,9-Apr-14,PA-07-070,5R01DK088199-05,5,R01,DK,88199,5,,"PERRIN, PETER J",1-May-10,31-Aug-15,Gastrointestinal Mucosal Pathobiology Study Section (GMPB) ,,1877240,"BLUMBERG, RICHARD S.",Not Applicable,7,Unavailable,30811269,US,42.334978,-71.105987,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,BOSTON,MA,Unavailable,02115-6110,UNITED STATES, ,1-May-14,31-Aug-15,847,Research Projects,2014,NIDDK,352600,162637,515237,

The principal investigators will thus examine the microbiome in young adult members of a Faroese cohort followed since birth with dietary; medical and exposure information. At a clinical examination at age 28 years; where glucose metabolism will be characterized; they will obtain a suitable fecal sample from at least 500 cohort members to ascertain key characteristics of the microbiome in regard to exposures and clinical data. This study will thus contribute to our understanding of the microbiome's potential impact on glucose metabolism as a key health parameter and its sensitivity to environmental chemical exposures during early postnatal life and later in life.            ,NIEHS,8605599,29-Jan-14,RFA-ES-12-009,1R21ES023376-01,1,R21,ES,23376,1,,"CHADWICK, LISA ",29-Jan-14,31-Dec-16,Special Emphasis Panel (ZES1-JAB-J (MB)),,1877010,"GRANDJEAN, PHILIPPE ADAM",Not Applicable,7,PUBLIC HEALTH & PREV MEDICINE,149617367,US,42.335241,-71.102433,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,BOSTON,MA,SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH,02115-6028,UNITED STATES, ,29-Jan-14,31-Dec-14,113,Research Projects,2014,NIEHS,207773,85261,293034,

We have observed that bacteria can mediate gene silencing in mammalian cells (a process termed transkingdom RNAi); and have recently designed a transkingdom gene silencing therapy for familial adenatomous polyposis (FAP) which has been cleared by the FDA for phase Ia/II clinical trials; and is based on oral administration of bacteria capable of inducing RNAi against beta-catenin. To support and enhance the clinical development of this approach; the studies outlined in this proposal will elucidate the mechanism of bacteria-mediated RNAi; identify biomarkers for clinical development; and develop a next generation transkingdom gene silencing technology to further improve the long-term efficacy and safety of using non- pathogenic or probiotic bacteria to treat a broad spectrum of human diseases.            ,NIGMS,8657061,24-Apr-14,PA-10-067,5R01GM102246-03,5,R01,GM,102246,3,,"BENDER, MICHAEL T.",1-Aug-12,30-Apr-17,Therapeutic Approaches to Genetic Diseases (TAG) ,,9087756,"LI, CHIANG JIA",Not Applicable,7,Unavailable,71723621,US,42.346758,-71.10256,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,BOSTON,MA,Unavailable,02215-5400,UNITED STATES, ,1-May-14,30-Apr-15,859,Research Projects,2014,NIGMS,190000,140600,330600,

Rapidlyadvancing DNA sequencing capabilities have altered profoundly the volume of sequence data that can beprocessed in a study. However several bottlenecks to the analysis of this DNA sequence data must beovercome as the scale of studies expands. These include several issues concerned with the quality assuranceof primary DNA sequence data; as well as interpretation of results drawn from these data; for instance theaccuracy of identifying microorganisms in a specimen based solely on DNA sequence. In this project; wepropose to build a software infrastructure based on a high-precision DNA sequence analysis tool (INFERNAL);that addresses many of the critical barriers to progress currently facing researchers in the metagenomics field. In this two-year project; the base software technology; developed by Prof. Eddy (Co-Investigator) andcolleagues to identify and annotate RNA genes in genomes; will be adapted to the needs of the metagenomicscommunity through joint development by the Pace and Eddy groups. This research team will use theirextensive backgrounds in RNA structural biology; molecular-evolution; and computational biology to build andvalidate software tools that extend the basic feature set of INFERNAL; with special emphasis on facilitatingresearch carried out in the NIH Human Microbiome Project.1,NHGRI,8021062,26-Sep-10,RFA-RM-09-021,1R21HG005964-01,1,R21,HG,5964,1,,"PROCTOR, LITA ",27-Sep-10,30-Jun-11,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-GGG-N (50)),,9866279,"FRANK, DANIEL ",Not Applicable,2,BIOCHEMISTRY,7431505,US,40.027599,-105.251595,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,BOULDER,CO,SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES,80303-1058,UNITED STATES, ,27-Sep-10,30-Jun-11,310,Research Projects,2010,OD,,,227250,

These studies serve to further our understanding as to how to exploit RNAs as targets of therapeutics via structure-based drug design or manipulate bacterial physiology to address health issues related to the composition of human microbiome.         ,NIGMS,8657054,24-Apr-14,PA-11-260,5R01GM083953-07,5,R01,GM,83953,7,,"LEWIS, CATHERINE D.",1-May-08,30-Apr-16,Macromolecular Structure and Function B Study Section (MSFB) ,,1875870,"BATEY, ROBERT T",Not Applicable,2,CHEMISTRY,7431505,US,40.027599,-105.251595,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,BOULDER,CO,SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES,80303-1058,UNITED STATES, ,1-May-14,30-Apr-15,859,Research Projects,2014,NIGMS,205820,94771,300591,

Cervix cancer can be prevented by Pap smear testing and/or HR-HPV detection to identify women with precancerous lesions that can be treated. This study will investigate novel markers on the human papillomavirus genome and in the cervical environment (cervical microbiome) that have the potential to identify HR-HPV infected women at greatest risk for cervix cancer that can be treated; while preventing women at lower risk from having an invasive procedure.            ,NCI,8632518,26-Jun-14,PA-11-260,2U01CA078527-16A1,2,U01,CA,78527,16,A1,"STARKS, VAURICE ",24-Jul-98,30-Jun-19,Epidemiology of Cancer Study Section (EPIC) ,,1879584,"BURK, ROBERT D.",Not Applicable,14,PEDIATRICS,110521739,US,40.851026,-73.844361,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,BRONX,NY,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,10461-1900,UNITED STATES, ,1-Jul-14,30-Jun-15,393,Research Projects,2014,NCI,348258,233333,581591,

The currently approved platform treatments for MS are immunomodulatory (glatiramer acetate and interferon- beta) and result in a modest effect on clinical relapse rate but are safe with very few adverse side effects.More recent therapies either approved by the FDA or under consideration for registration appear to have greater impact on relapse rate but can exhibit potent immune suppression (fingolimod; natalizumab) or immune ablation (rituximab; ocrilizumab; alemtuzumab) of the immune system; and are increasingly associated with serious adverse events including cardiac arrhythmia; opportunistic infections such as PML; and profound long- term lymphopenia. Recent work emerging from the human microbiome; which is the collection of &gt;10;000 microbial species that live on and in the human body; has identified a specific bacterial species that resides in the human gut as crucial to maintaining a healthy immune system and protecting against immune-mediated diseases such as MS. The scientific founders of our company have closely studied this microbe; Bacteroides fragilis; and have identified the single molecule that is responsible forthe protective effect. Symbiotix Biotherapies; Inc. is a startup biotechnology company formed to bring this new therapy to patients as an orally administered; safe and effective treatment for MS; and the Phase 1 STTR project will enable crucial studies that will give us safety and efficacy information needed to take this therapy into human clinical trials.            ,NIAID,8647277,21-Feb-14,PA-13-089,1R41AI110170-01,1,R41,AI,110170,1,,"PROGRAIS, LAWRENCE J.",1-Mar-14,28-Feb-15,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-ETTN-M (11)),,1864211,"KASPER, LLOYD H",Not Applicable,4,Unavailable,78732474,US,,,"SYMBIOTIX BIOTHERAPIES, INC.",BROOKLINE,MA,Unavailable,02445-5712,UNITED STATES, ,1-Mar-14,28-Feb-15,855,SBIR-STTR,2014,NIAID,,,322928,

We will test the hypothesis that PT modifications confer a selective advantage to gut microbes during the oxidative and nitrosative stresses of inflammation and colitis; using a convergence of novel technologies; including mouse models of colitis; ultrasensitive analytical techniques; genome sequencing and bioinformatics; to define the spectrum of gut bacteria possessing PT modifications and changes in gut microbiota caused by inflammation. With etiological implications for inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer; the significance of these studies lies in the potential clinical impact of a horizontally transferred DNA modification system that may confer resistance to inflammation and that is widespread in both the human microbiome and clinically important bacterial pathogens.         ,NIAID,8751068,28-Jul-14,PA-13-303,1R21AI112711-01,1,R21,AI,112711,1,,"ROTHERMEL, ANNETTE L.",1-Aug-14,31-Jul-16,Gastrointestinal Mucosal Pathobiology Study Section (GMPB) ,,1886400,"DEDON, PETER C",Not Applicable,7,NONE,1425594,US,42.359476,-71.093853,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,CAMBRIDGE,MA,SCHOOLS OF ENGINEERING,2142,UNITED STATES, ,1-Aug-14,31-Jul-15,855,Research Projects,2014,NIAID,125000,70000,195000,

The proposed research will investigate a newly discovered gene; TBONE (Target of BisphOsphonate NitrogEnous) that is critical for the therapeutic effects of phosphonates. This work suggests an entirely new understanding of important medicines and also a new therapeutic approach in aging-one that is dietary; and likely considerably safer than that of taking bisphosphonates.                       ,NIA,8678273,17-Mar-14,PA-11-197,1K99AG047255-01,1,K99,AG,47255,1,,"WILLIAMS, JOHN ",1-Apr-14,31-Mar-16,National Institute on Aging Initial Review Group (NIA) ,,10906289,"PETERSON, TIMOTHY ",Not Applicable,5,MICROBIOLOGY/IMMUN/VIROLOGY,82359691,US,42.373148,-71.118329,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,CAMBRIDGE,MA,SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES,02138-3846,UNITED STATES, ,1-Apr-14,31-Mar-15,866,Other Research-Related,2014,NIA,106770,8542,115312,

This is an extremely important problem; because vaginal infections such as bacterial vaginosis afflict over one billion women every year and pose major risks for fertility; preterm birth; pregnancy complications; prenatal infections; and susceptibility to sexually transmitted diseases. Results from these novel genomics-based studies will be important for providing clinicians with measures for reliably diagnosing and treating patients with bacterial vaginosis.,NIAID,8131293,7-Sep-10,PA-07-070,1R56AI085096-01,1,R56,AI,85096,1,,"DAVID, HAGIT S.",7-Sep-10,30-Jun-13,Clinical Research and Field Studies of Infectious Diseases Study Section (CRFS) ,,8915273,"WHITE, BRYAN ",Not Applicable,13,GENETICS,41544081,US,40.094458,-88.238635,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,CHAMPAIGN,IL,ORGANIZED RESEARCH UNITS,61820-7406,UNITED STATES,YES,7-Sep-10,30-Jun-13,701,Research Projects,2010,NIAID,,,659510,

Lung,2012,Interdisciplinary Study;Lung diseases;Research Training;,MULTIDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH TRAINING IN PULMONARY DISEASES,Project Narrative Our Program will provide young M.D.; M.D./Ph.D. and Ph.D. investigators with state-of-the-art research training in common and rare lung diseases affecting the pediatric and adult populations. Lung diseases such as lung infections including pneumonia; cigarette smoke-associated lung diseases; genetic diseases of the airways including cystic fibrosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia; and lung diseases with an environmental component such as asthma and other allergic lung diseases are common and are associated with devastating morbidity; mortality and use of health care dollars. Our Program includes 52 faculty serving as mentors for our trainees and provides a highly multidisciplinary pulmonary scientific community that creates an outstanding opportunity for trainees to develop their technical and intellectual abilities as scientists and become independent investigators within the national community; pursuing important questions about the pathogenesis and course of lung diseases in pediatric and adult populations and developing novel pharmacologic and gene therapy treatments.,NHLBI,8214413,20-Feb-12,PA-10-036,2T32HL007106-36,2,T32,HL,7106,36,,"TIGNO, XENIA ",1-Jul-75,31-Mar-17,NHLBI Institutional Training Mechanism Review Committee (NITM) ,,1882826,"DOERSCHUK, CLAIRE M ","BOUCHER, RICHARD CHARLES;DAVIS, STEPHANIE DUGGINS",4,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,608195277,US,35.926939,-79.038605,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,CHAPEL HILL,NC,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,27599-0001,UNITED STATES, ,1-Apr-12,31-Mar-13,837,Training; Institutional,2012,NHLBI,384491,28835,406452,

An average of about 6 people die every hour of colorectal cancer and approximately 150;000 new cases are diagnosed annually. Colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) represents a major form of cancer and a serious medical complication for patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The economic burden for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) treatment is significant with annual costs in the United States estimated to be $6.3 billion. Despite this health and socio-economical burden; limited therapeutic options are currently available to prevent/treat colorectal cancer. This project investigates the role of bacteria on development of CAC through the use of metagenomic; gnotobiotic and microbial genetic approaches. Our hypothesis is that specific bacterial entities promote development of CRC through expression of microbial genotoxic products; resulting in enhanced host genomic instability and formation of neoplastic lesions. This project will lead to the generation of novel paradigm regarding CAC and potentially identify new cancer biomarkers.            ,NIDDK,8308078,2-Mar-12,PA-10-067,2R01DK073338-05A1,2,R01,DK,73338,5,A1,"GREY, MICHAEL J",1-Apr-07,31-Mar-17,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-DKUS-C (03)),,7039510,"JOBIN, CHRISTIAN ",Not Applicable,4,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,608195277,US,35.926939,-79.038605,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,CHAPEL HILL,NC,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,27599-0001,UNITED STATES, ,1-Apr-12,31-Mar-13,847,Research Projects,2012,NIDDK,249259,118662,367921,

The development of such therapies requires the identification of the key molecular drivers of this disease. This translational research project wil study a large multicentric cohort of patients with alcoholic hepatitis using next-generation technologies in order to provide a precise molecular characterization of the patients and identify key disease drivers. By using systems biology models to integrate data obtained with RNA sequencing and kinase analysis; we will be able identify different molecular subtypes based on the prevailing disease mechanism. These results can be very useful for the designing of successful clinical trials with novel targeted therapies.            ,NIAAA,8428285,1-Jun-13,RFA-AA-12-007,1U01AA021908-01,1,U01,AA,21908,1,,"WANG, JOE ",1-Jun-13,31-May-18,Special Emphasis Panel (ZAA1-JJ (07)),,11253392,"BATALLER, RAMON ",Not Applicable,4,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,608195277,US,35.926939,-79.038605,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,CHAPEL HILL,NC,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,27599-0001,UNITED STATES, ,1-Jun-13,31-May-14,273,Research Projects,2013,NIAAA,868602,346676,1215278,

An average of about 6 people die every hour of colorectal cancer and approximately 150;000 new cases are diagnosed annually. Colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) represents a major form of cancer and a serious medical complication for patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The economic burden for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) treatment is significant with annual costs in the United States estimated to be $6.3 billion. Despite this health and socio-economical burden; limited therapeutic options are currently available to prevent/treat colorectal cancer. This project investigates the role of bacteria on development of CAC through the use of metagenomic; gnotobiotic and microbial genetic approaches. Our hypothesis is that specific bacterial entities promote development of CRC through expression of microbial genotoxic products; resulting in enhanced host genomic instability and formation of neoplastic lesions. This project will lead to the generation of novel paradigm regarding CAC and potentially identify new cancer biomarkers.            ,NIDDK,8437150,20-Mar-13,PA-10-067,5R01DK073338-06,5,R01,DK,73338,6,,"GREY, MICHAEL J",1-Apr-07,30-Jun-13,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-DKUS-C (03)),,7039510,"JOBIN, CHRISTIAN ",Not Applicable,4,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,608195277,US,35.926939,-79.038605,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,CHAPEL HILL,NC,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,27599-0001,UNITED STATES, ,1-Apr-13,30-Jun-13,847,Research Projects,2013,NIDDK,71956,22006,93962,

We propose to synthesize and identify promising new drug candidates to prevent severe diarrhea associated with the widely used; but frequently toxic; chemotherapeutic agent irinotecan. This approach is not only expected to enhance the quality of life of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy; but may also improve chemotherapeutic outcomes. Our technology may also be useful for other drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that produce intestinal side effects with the same bacterial-based mechanism of toxicity.         ,NCI,8714263,6-Aug-14,PA-13-234,1R43CA180270-01A1,1,R43,CA,180270,1,A1,"RAHBAR, AMIR M",6-Aug-14,31-Jul-15,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-DKUS-N (10)),,11665158,"PETERSON, WARD ",Not Applicable,4,Unavailable,78519208,US,,,"SYMBERIX, LLC",CHAPEL HILL,NC,Unavailable,27599-0001,UNITED STATES, ,6-Aug-14,31-Jul-15,395,SBIR-STTR,2014,NCI,,,225000,

The current therapeutic approaches to C. difficile treatment are clearly inadequate since there is a high mortality and recurrent infections. There is thus an urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches for treatment of C. difficile infections.

Our main hypothesis is that one key reason whysome alcoholics get ALD is because chronic alcohol use changes the intestinal bacteria which has long termeffects on a persons metabolism and immune system. It can also cause the intestines to be leaky and allowmore bad things to enter the blood. In this study we will look at samples from alcoholics with and without liverdisease as well as other patient groups and identify the alcohol-related profile of their intestinal bacteria andhow it affects their metabolism and immune system. This analysis will allow us to identify new kinds of alcohol-related biomarkers of intestinal bacteria; immune function; and metabolism to help us identify patients at riskfor ALD and to help treat ALD patients.,NIAAA,7853129,30-Sep-09,RFA-OD-09-004,1RC2AA019405-01,1,RC2,AA,19405,1,,"JUNG, KATHY ",30-Sep-09,31-Aug-11,Special Emphasis Panel (ZAA1-GG (02)),,1966640,"KESHAVARZIAN, ALI  ","GILLEVET, PATRICK MARTIN",7,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,68610245,US,41.875066,-87.66796,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,CHICAGO,IL,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,60612-3833,UNITED STATES,YES,30-Sep-09,31-Aug-10,701,Research Projects,2009,NIAAA,,,988920,

Our main hypothesis is that one key reason whysome alcoholics get ALD is because chronic alcohol use changes the intestinal bacteria which has long termeffects on a persons metabolism and immune system. It can also cause the intestines to be leaky and allowmore bad things to enter the blood. In this study we will look at samples from alcoholics with and without liverdisease as well as other patient groups and identify the alcohol-related profile of their intestinal bacteria andhow it affects their metabolism and immune system. This analysis will allow us to identify new kinds of alcohol-related biomarkers of intestinal bacteria; immune function; and metabolism to help us identify patients at riskfor ALD and to help treat ALD patients.,NIAAA,7944066,20-Aug-10,RFA-OD-09-004,5RC2AA019405-02,5,RC2,AA,19405,2,,"JUNG, KATHY ",30-Sep-09,31-Aug-12,Special Emphasis Panel (ZAA1-GG (02)),,1966640,"KESHAVARZIAN, ALI  ","GILLEVET, PATRICK MARTIN",7,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,68610245,US,41.875066,-87.66796,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,CHICAGO,IL,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,60612-3833,UNITED STATES,YES,1-Sep-10,31-Aug-12,701,Research Projects,2010,NIAAA,,,985241,

Until recently it has been unclear how metabolic disturbances might underlie autoimmune and inflammatory disorders; but a recent discovery in mice suggests that there may be a direct link. Mice defective in certain aspects of intestinal lipid metabolism have been found to also have dysregulated intestinal immunity. In this project; we will characterize the genes involved in both the metabolic defect and the change in immunity; and then determine the role of the commensal intestinal bacteria in these changes. An understanding of the mechanisms by which metabolic disruption induces immune dysregulation may lead to methods for early detection and intervention in autoimmune and inflammatory disorders.               ,NIAID,8570897,6-Aug-13,PA-11-261,1R21AI107485-01,1,R21,AI,107485,1,,"ROTHERMEL, ANNETTE L.",6-Aug-13,31-Jul-15,Cellular and Molecular Immunology - B Study Section (CMIB) ,,6262993,"JABRI, BANA ",Not Applicable,1,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,5421136,US,41.789554,-87.601172,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,CHICAGO,IL,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,60637-5418,UNITED STATES, ,6-Aug-13,31-Jul-14,855,Research Projects,2013,NIAID,123519,71641,195160,

In our recent funding cycle we discovered that the local concentration of phosphate (Pi) is a universal cue among hospital acquired pathogens that enhances microbial virulence expression when Pi is deficient yet inhibits virulence when Pi is abundant. Therefore as a countermeasure to prevent intestinal microbial virulence activation and its consequences during surgical injury; we have synthesized a unique phosphate based polymer (Pi-PEG) that inhibits virulence activation in intestinal pathogens and protects against mortality and now seek to determine its mechanism of action and applicability in relevant cellular and animal models of surgical injury.

We will develop a plan for a multi-centered phase II clinical trial in which patients undergo serial endoscopic surveillance (SES) of their anastomotic tissues as they heal with an in- depth microbial analysis in order to correlate healing to microbia composition and virulence phenotype (harmful properties). As part of the trial half the patients will be randomized to those that receive direct topical antibiotics applied to the anastomotic tissues during the endoscopy (SES) to eliminate potentially harmful microbes and half will receive a placebo during the SES and the contribution of microbes to the healing process of an anastomosis will be determined.            ,NIGMS,8756542,19-Sep-14,PAR-11-287,1R34GM111550-01,1,R34,GM,111550,1,,"SOMERS, SCOTT D.",20-Sep-14,19-Sep-15,Special Emphasis Panel (ZGM1-PPBC-C (CT)),,2186390,"ALVERDY, JOHN C.",Not Applicable,1,SURGERY,5421136,US,41.789554,-87.601172,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,CHICAGO,IL,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,60637-5418,UNITED STATES, ,20-Sep-14,19-Sep-15,859,Research Projects,2014,NIGMS,103764,54586,158350,

Until recently it has been unclear how metabolic disturbances might underlie autoimmune and inflammatory disorders; but a recent discovery in mice suggests that there may be a direct link. Mice defective in certain aspects of intestinal lipid metabolism have been found to also have dysregulated intestinal immunity. In this project; we will characterize the genes involved in both the metabolic defect and the change in immunity; and then determine the role of the commensal intestinal bacteria in these changes. An understanding of the mechanisms by which metabolic disruption induces immune dysregulation may lead to methods for early detection and intervention in autoimmune and inflammatory disorders.,NIAID,8715690,17-Jul-14,PA-11-261,5R21AI107485-02,5,R21,AI,107485,2,,"ROTHERMEL, ANNETTE L.",6-Aug-13,31-Jul-15,Cellular and Molecular Immunology - B Study Section (CMIB) ,,6262993,"JABRI, BANA ",Not Applicable,1,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,5421136,US,41.789554,-87.601172,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,CHICAGO,IL,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,60637-5418,UNITED STATES, ,1-Aug-14,31-Jul-15,855,Research Projects,2014,NIAID,156577,81420,237997,

The process of colonization causes a change in amounts of fucose-containing and sialic acid- containing sugars in the gastrointestinal tract. This project will study 600 extremely low birthweight infants in Cincinnati and Birmingham to test the measurement of saliva and the genes that control the synthesis of these sugars as novel biomarkers of risk of NEC and indicators of intestinal colonization.      ,NICHD,8427342,14-Jan-13,RFA-HD-07-018,5R01HD059140-05,5,R01,HD,59140,5,,"GRAVE, GILMAN D.",15-Jan-09,31-Dec-14,Special Emphasis Panel (ZHD1-DSR-A (18)),,3085267,"MORROW, ARDYTHE L",Not Applicable,1,Unavailable,71284913,US,39.140882,-84.500494,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,CINCINNATI,OH,Unavailable,45229-3039,UNITED STATES, ,1-Jan-13,31-Dec-14,865,Research Projects,2013,NICHD,566402,105699,672101,

Individual species of bacteria are specific to different areas of the body; and individual humans share many of the same species at the same body site. How these native bacteria are acquired and how stable they are over time is not known. The proposed studies will reveal how oral microbial communities are acquired starting at birth and tracking children through adolescence; and will show how long they are retained. This will indicate how much human oral health might be predetermined by bacteria acquired early in life; and how easy it would be to change bacteria to a healthy profile with probiotics or other strategies.            ,NIDCR,8705214,24-Apr-14,PA-11-260,1R01DE024327-01,1,R01,DE,24327,1,,"LUNSFORD, DWAYNE ",1-May-14,31-Mar-19,"Oral, Dental and Craniofacial Sciences Study Section (ODCS) ",,6603416,"GRIFFEN, ANN L.

The proposed studies will establish a definitive role for oral bacteria in mediating the formation of BRB bioactives and provide: (i) a panel of bacterial markers for BRB exposure and (ii) biologically validated timelines for BRB treatment in patients at high risk for developing oral cancer; namely; smokers; in a future; phase III clinical trial. Outcomes of these studies will help accomplish our long-term goal of developing food-based strategies for disease prevention; point-of-care diagnostics and biological metrics for successful treatment outcomes in high-risk populations high at-risk for the development of oral malignancies.            ,NCI,8769882,21-Aug-14,PAR-13-159,1U01CA188250-01,1,U01,CA,188250,1,,"ROSS, SHARON A.",1-Sep-14,31-Aug-19,Special Emphasis Panel (ZCA1-SRLB-Y (M1)),,1857736,"WEGHORST, CHRISTOPHER M ","CLINTON, STEVEN K;KUMAR, PURNIMA ;SCHWARTZ, STEVEN J",3,PUBLIC HEALTH & PREV MEDICINE,832127323,US,40.003166,-83.034278,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,COLUMBUS,OH,SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH,43210-1016,UNITED STATES, ,1-Sep-14,31-Aug-15,393,Research Projects,2014,NCI,413519,223300,636819,

AUREUS COLONIZATION AND INFECTION,Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infection was a coded diagnosis in 1.3% of veterans discharged from VA hospitals in 2007. The high rate of MRSA infection in VA hospitals nationwide has prompted a national control effort focused on patients with nasal MRSA colonization; as sources of spread within hospitals. In addition to the risk of transmission to others; patients colonized with MRSA are at increased risk for invasive infection. In our hospital; the incidence of MSSA bacteremia is nearly double that of MRSA; making it a pathogen of significant concern. The role of the nasal microbiome in host defense against MRSA colonization; and MRSA or MSSA infection has not been examined longitudinally in association with relevant clinical parameters. There may be organisms; or consortia of organisms in the nares; that reduce the risk of MRSA colonization and/or S. aureus invasion causing bloodstream infection.

AUREUS COLONIZATION AND INFECTION,Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infection was a coded diagnosis in 1.3% of veterans discharged from VA hospitals in 2007. The high rate of MRSA infection in VA hospitals nationwide has prompted a national control effort focused on patients with nasal MRSA colonization; as sources of spread within hospitals. In addition to the risk of transmission to others; patients colonized with MRSA are at increased risk for invasive infection. In our hospital; the incidence of MSSA bacteremia is nearly double that of MRSA; making it a pathogen of significant concern. The role of the nasal microbiome in host defense against MRSA colonization; and MRSA or MSSA infection has not been examined longitudinally in association with relevant clinical parameters. There may be organisms; or consortia of organisms in the nares; that reduce the risk of MRSA colonization and/or S. aureus invasion causing bloodstream infection. We propose to study the role of the nasal microbiome in MRSA colonization and S. aureus bloodstream infection of a veteran population with a goal of developing strategies to prevent these infections.,VA,8696834,7-Feb-14,RFA-BX-11-014,5I01BX001178-03,5,I01,VA,1178,3,,Unavailable,1-Jul-12,30-Jun-16,Infectious Diseases B (INFB) ,,10371272,"BESSESEN, MARY ",Not Applicable,1,Unavailable,3252830,US,39.732591,-104.935144,VA EASTERN COLORADO HEALTH CARE SYSTEM,DENVER,CO,Unavailable,80220-3808,UNITED STATES, ,1-Jul-14,30-Jun-15,999,Research Projects,2014,,,,,

The etiology of BV remains unknown; hence cure rates remain unsatisfactory and recurrence rates are 30-68% (19-21). Cost-effective diagnosis and prognosis of bacterial vaginosis; working towards an effective POC and home-care device; is needed. Traditional and pipeline tools are not adequate for diagnosis and are entirely non-prognostic. The novel; qPCR-based approach proposed for validation here; Lactobacillus Relative Composition (LbRC); is able to recognize patients whose therapy was incomplete; potentially distinguishing it from all competing assays; and has facilitated our discovery of a later event we define as conversion. Conversion is a global change in vaginal microbiota that occurs well before symptomatic BV. LbRC offers the much needed possibility of individualized alternative therapies when standard of care is not adequate; or later; at pre-BV conversion events; to allow for intervention before symptoms of BV recur. LbRC uses a superior strategy relative to competing assays; costs &lt;$0.20 in materials per assay; uses equipment standard to clinical microbiology labs; and runs &gt;40 batched assays at a time; commensurate with hospital throughput; and is a powerful tool for discovery of species involved in causing conversion.         ,NIAID,8683643,7-Feb-14,PA-11-261,1R21AI111103-01,1,R21,AI,111103,1,,"DAVID, HAGIT S.",7-Feb-14,31-Jan-16,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-IDM-V (12)),,1917904,"AKINS, ROBERT A",Not Applicable,13,BIOCHEMISTRY,1962224,US,42.35738,-83.064737,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,DETROIT,MI,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,48202-4050,UNITED STATES, ,7-Feb-14,31-Jan-15,855,Research Projects,2014,NIAID,175000,78000,253000,

During this time innate immunity synergizes with the emergence of adaptive immunity to establish the breadth and character of the child's immune response. Breastfeeding is associated with immunologic benefit including more robust responses to vaccination but the mechanism by which it enhances immunity is unknown. This application will examine the relationship between breast feeding; the emergence of the gastrointestinal microbiome; innate immunity; and the development of adaptive immunity to vaccination.,NIAID,8704874,23-Jul-14,RFA-AI-11-010,5R01AI100147-04,5,R01,AI,100147,4,,"PRABHUDAS, MERCY R.",23-Aug-12,31-Jul-17,Special Emphasis Panel (ZAI1-LGR-I (J1)),,2501308,"SLEASMAN, JOHN W",Not Applicable,1,PEDIATRICS,44387793,US,36.006824,-78.924579,DUKE UNIVERSITY,DURHAM,NC,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,27705-4673,UNITED STATES, ,1-Aug-14,31-Jul-15,855,Research Projects,2014,NIAID,392073,54719,446792,

They compromise nutrition and speech; prolong hospital stays; predispose patients to blood-stream infections and cause delays or dose reductions in the delivery of cancer treatment. Despite the clinical significance of these lesions;the specific cellular events involved in their pathogenesis are poorly understood and thus effective therapies or prevention strategies are currently lacking.

This disease occurs when the tooth is damaged by bacteria on the tooth surface that produce acids from sugars. The goals of this research are to understand how the bacteria that cause caries coordinate the uptake and metabolism of sugars to maximize their growth and acid production. The project has high public health relevance because of the widespread nature of the disease and the high potential of the research to identify new technologies for the prevention or treatment of dental caries. The findings are also highly relevant to a variety of other human pathogens that are genetically and physiologically similar to the bacteria that cause dental caries.            ,NIDCR,8437891,29-Apr-13,PA-11-260,2R01DE012236-17A1,2,R01,DE,12236,17,A1,"LUNSFORD, DWAYNE ",1-Apr-97,30-Apr-18,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-MOSS-B (03)),,1883700,"BURNE, ROBERT A",Not Applicable,3,DENTISTRY,969663814,US,29.67667,-82.340932,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,GAINESVILLE,FL,SCHOOLS OF DENTISTRY,32611-5500,UNITED STATES, ,1-May-13,30-Apr-14,121,Research Projects,2013,NIDCR,250000,116250,366250,

An average of about 6 people die every hour of colorectal cancer and approximately 150;000 new cases are diagnosed annually. Colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) represents a major form of cancer and a serious medical complication for patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The economic burden for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) treatment is significant with annual costs in the United States estimated to be $6.3 billion. Despite this health and socio-economical burden; limited therapeutic options are currently available to prevent/treat colorectal cancer. This project investigates the role of bacteria on development of CAC through the use of metagenomic; gnotobiotic and microbial genetic approaches. Our hypothesis is that specific bacterial entities promote development of CRC through expression of microbial genotoxic products; resulting in enhanced host genomic instability and formation of neoplastic lesions. This project will lead to the generation of novel paradigm regarding CAC and potentially identify new cancer biomarkers.            ,NIDDK,8753629,17-Dec-13,PA-10-067,7R01DK073338-07,7,R01,DK,73338,7,,"GREY, MICHAEL J",1-Apr-07,31-Mar-17,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-DKUS-C (03)),,7039510,"JOBIN, CHRISTIAN ",Not Applicable,3,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,969663814,US,29.67667,-82.340932,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,GAINESVILLE,FL,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,32611-5500,UNITED STATES, ,11-Dec-13,31-Mar-14,847,Research Projects,2013,NIDDK,168589,82609,251198,

This disease occurs when the tooth is damaged by bacteria on the tooth surface that produce acids from sugars. The goals of this research are to understand how the bacteria that cause caries coordinate the uptake and metabolism of sugars to maximize their growth and acid production. The project has high public health relevance because of the widespread nature of the disease and the high potential of the research to identify new technologies for the prevention or treatment of dental caries. The findings are also highly relevant to a variety of other human pathogens that are genetically and physiologically similar to the bacteria that cause dental caries.            ,NIDCR,8656676,9-Apr-14,PA-11-260,5R01DE012236-18,5,R01,DE,12236,18,,"LUNSFORD, DWAYNE ",1-Apr-97,30-Apr-18,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-MOSS-B (03)),,1883700,"BURNE, ROBERT A",Not Applicable,3,DENTISTRY,969663814,US,29.67667,-82.340932,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,GAINESVILLE,FL,SCHOOLS OF DENTISTRY,32611-5500,UNITED STATES, ,1-May-14,30-Apr-15,121,Research Projects,2014,NIDCR,250000,124271,374271,

Our published results from a funded R21 demonstrated that vitamin D can increase the immune defenses of gingival cells against the bacteria associated with periodontal disease. Here we propose to study the mechanism by which this occurs; and to determine whether we can prevent bacteria-induced periodontal disease in a mouse model.

An average of about 6 people die every hour of colorectal cancer and approximately 150;000 new cases are diagnosed annually. Colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) represents a major form of cancer and a serious medical complication for patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The economic burden for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) treatment is significant with annual costs in the United States estimated to be $6.3 billion. Despite this health and socio-economical burden; limited therapeutic options are currently available to prevent/treat colorectal cancer. This project investigates the role of bacteria on development of CAC through the use of metagenomic; gnotobiotic and microbial genetic approaches. Our hypothesis is that specific bacterial entities promote development of CRC through expression of microbial genotoxic products; resulting in enhanced host genomic instability and formation of neoplastic lesions. This project will lead to the generation of novel paradigm regarding CAC and potentially identify new cancer biomarkers.            ,NIDDK,8639546,10-Mar-14,PA-10-067,5R01DK073338-08,5,R01,DK,73338,8,,"PERRIN, PETER J",1-Apr-07,31-Mar-17,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-DKUS-C (03)),,7039510,"JOBIN, CHRISTIAN ",Not Applicable,3,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,969663814,US,29.67667,-82.340932,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,GAINESVILLE,FL,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,32611-5500,UNITED STATES, ,1-Apr-14,31-Mar-15,847,Research Projects,2014,NIDDK,249259,110550,359809,

This study will fill major gaps in our understanding of the importance of alkali production in promoting dental health and preventing caries in children. The information gained will provide the foundation for the development of novel and highly effective risk assessment strategies and therapies for caries prevention and treatment based on oral alkali production; while at the same time contributing to a much deeper understanding of the composition and behavior of the oral microflora in health and disease.         ,NIDCR,8699583,6-Apr-14,PA-11-194,1K23DE023579-01A1,1,K23,DE,23579,1,A1,"KING, LYNN M",6-Apr-14,31-Mar-19,NIDCR Special Grants Review Committee (DSR) ,,9612150,"NASCIMENTO, MARCELLE M.",Not Applicable,3,DENTISTRY,969663814,US,29.67667,-82.340932,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,GAINESVILLE,FL,SCHOOLS OF DENTISTRY,32611-5500,UNITED STATES, ,6-Apr-14,31-Mar-15,121,Other Research-Related,2014,NIDCR,119725,9578,129303,

This proposal investigates the role of the gut commensal bacteria; in particular B. fragilis; in regulating central nervous system demyelination. We have observed that a single purified bacterial polysaccharide (PSA) can protect against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE); the animal model of human multiple sclerosis. The immunologic mechanism by which this occurs appears related to the induction and polarization of a gut associated dendritic cell population and the amplification of both a T and B regulatory response.            ,NIAID,8484553,28-Jun-12,PA-11-260,1R56AI098282-01A1,1,R56,AI,98282,1,A1,"ESCH, THOMAS R.",1-Jul-12,30-Jun-14,Clinical Neuroimmunology and Brain Tumors Study Section (CNBT) ,,1864211,"KASPER, LLOYD H",Not Applicable,2,MICROBIOLOGY/IMMUN/VIROLOGY,41027822,US,43.709674,-72.286767,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,HANOVER,NH,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,03755-1421,UNITED STATES, ,1-Jul-12,30-Jun-14,855,Research Projects,2012,NIAID,171739,104761,276500,

Past studies relied on imperfect measures of fatness (weight for height; waist circumference) and did not often study risk differences among ethnic/racial groups. We propose to measure body fat directly using imaging methods (DXA and MRI) and identify blood biomarkers and lifestyle behaviors that predict body fat distribution in a multiethnic population; n order to test their associations with risks of breast and colorectal cancers in a prospective multiethnic study.,NCI,8729303,28-Aug-14,PAR-09-025,5P01CA168530-03,5,P01,CA,168530,3,,"MAHABIR, SOMDAT ",1-Sep-12,31-Aug-17,Special Emphasis Panel (ZCA1-RPRB-B (M1)),,1898900,"LE MARCHAND, LOIC ",Not Applicable,1,NONE,965088057,US,21.296806,-157.818506,UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AT MANOA,HONOLULU,HI,ORGANIZED RESEARCH UNITS,96822-2234,UNITED STATES, ,1-Sep-14,31-Aug-15,393,Research Projects,2014,NCI,4526803,494790,5021593,

A better understanding of the relationship between microorganisms in the gut and bone has the potential to lead to probiotic treatments for osteoporosis.         ,NIAMS,8596224,25-Jun-13,PA-11-114,1F33AR065348-01,1,F33,AR,65348,1,,"SHARROCK, WILLIAM J.",15-Aug-13,14-Aug-14,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-F10B-S (20)),,8608000,"HERNANDEZ, CHRISTOPHER JOHN",Not Applicable,23,ENGINEERING (ALL TYPES),872612445,US,42.434772,-76.463216,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,ITHACA,NY,SCHOOLS OF ENGINEERING,14850-2820,UNITED STATES, ,15-Aug-13,14-Aug-14,846,Training; Individual,2013,NIAMS,51022,,51022,

The purpose of this project is to examine several genes that have been identified to play a role in the cross-species communication of C. albicans with various bacteria. Understanding the genetics behind these interactions has the potential for developing new insight into how we can control C. albicans growth in immunocompromised patients; and assess the potential in utilizing bacterial molecules as novel antifungal agents thatcould lessen the impact of C. albicans on patient mortality.            ,NIAID,8768858,6-Jun-14,PA-13-313,1R15AI109581-01A1,1,R15,AI,109581,1,A1,"DUNCAN, RORY A.",15-Jun-14,31-May-17,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-IDM-S (81)),,1954416,"KRUPPA, MICHAEL D",Not Applicable,1,OTHER BASIC SCIENCES,51125037,US,36.302479,-82.36984,EAST TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHNSON CITY,TN,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,37614-6503,UNITED STATES, ,15-Jun-14,31-May-17,855,Research Projects,2014,NIAID,300000,121985,421985,

This joint effort between the AUA and the NIDDK is intended to be a rigorous and in-depth discussion of an overarching topic area that will spur progress in benign urologic conditions and that will attract leaders in the field; influential urology researchers; clinical urologists and early career investigators to the AUA Annual Meeting. The information presented at this meeting by experts in their respective fields; and the interactions and collaborations resulting from this meeting; are expected to promote a better understanding of the processes related to pelvic health and how they contribute to the development of lower urinary tract symptoms; and are expected to stimulate translation of laboratory findings into clinical settings and vice versa. The meeting is organized into three scientific sessions with ample question and answer periods. To add breadth and to emphasize the need for urgent progress in this area; the meeting will also feature a ""Public Perspective"" session to be provided by Missy Lavender; the Executive Director of the Women's Health Foundation. Leaders of the NIH Office of Research on Women's Health and the AUA and its affiliated specialty societies; including the Society for Basic Urology Research (SBUR); the Society for Urodynamics; Female Pelvic Medicine; and Urogenital Reconstruction (SUFU); the Sexual Medicine Society (SMS) and the Society for the Study of Male Reproduction (SSMR) will be specifically invited to attend.

CRC arises from adenomatous and serrated colon polyps that are identifiable with colonoscopy. The composition of the gut microbiome is thought to play a role in maintaining normal immunity and protecting the colon from damage that could lead to polyps; and then CRC. We propose to identify bacteria associated with colon polyps in order to further understand colon polyp development. As the U.S. population ages; colonoscopy and CRC will increasingly become a challenge and burden. This study could provide additional information useful for colonoscopy risk stratification and even prevention; with non-invasive interventions such as probiotics.         ,NCI,8639320,18-Dec-13,PAR-12-039,1R03CA173842-01A1,1,R03,CA,173842,1,A1,"STARKS, VAURICE ",1-Jan-14,31-Dec-15,Special Emphasis Panel (ZCA1-SRLB-D (O1)),,1865233,"COZEN, WENDY ",Not Applicable,37,PUBLIC HEALTH & PREV MEDICINE,72933393,US,34.065915,-118.196446,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,LOS ANGELES,CA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,90089-9235,UNITED STATES, ,1-Jan-14,31-Dec-14,393,Research Projects,2014,NCI,50000,32125,82125,

These studies are highly relevant as the IBDs affect approximately 1.4 million Americans; and are a significant cause of morbidity and healthcare costs particularly in the very important second and third decades of life.         ,NIDDK,8733652,12-Sep-14,RFA-DK-11-032,5U01DK062413-13,5,U01,DK,62413,13,,"KARP, ROBERT W",30-Sep-02,31-Aug-17,Special Emphasis Panel (ZDK1-GRB-G (O3)),,9369782,"MCGOVERN, DERMOT PATRICK",Not Applicable,28,Unavailable,75307785,US,34.076546,-118.380008,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,LOS ANGELES,CA,Unavailable,90048-1804,UNITED STATES, ,1-Sep-14,31-Aug-15,847,Research Projects,2014,NIDDK,267945,150374,418319,

This devastating disease is characterized by a lethal and progressive paralysis due to motor neuron degeneration for which there is no cure (yet). We hypothesize that that exposure to cyanobacteria is an environmental risk factor contributing to ALS by exposure to the neurotoxin BMAA. We propose that study of the gut microbiome offers novel insights into mechanisms of environmental exposure to this bacteria and neurotoxin in ALS.         ,NIEHS,8758601,25-Sep-14,RFA-ES-13-007,1R21ES024355-01,1,R21,ES,24355,1,,"KIRSHNER, ANNETTE G",25-Sep-14,31-Aug-16,Special Emphasis Panel (ZES1-LWJ-K (R)),,7354019,"OPHOFF, ROEL A",Not Applicable,33,NONE,92530369,US,34.104809,-118.41105,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,LOS ANGELES,CA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,90095-2000,UNITED STATES, ,25-Sep-14,31-Aug-15,113,Research Projects,2014,NIEHS,148901,80406,229307,

Preclinical studies are also designed to predict whether the microbicide we develop might be effective against HIV-1 transmission. A safe and effective rectal microbicide gel would have significant impact on preventing expansion of the domestic and global HIV-1 epidemic.      Project 1: PREVENT Program Critical Path Project   Project Leader (PL): Tuse; Daniel      DESCRIPTION (as provided by applicant): The overall goal of the Critical Path Project (CPP""; Project 1) is to coordinate cGMP-compliant Drug Substance and Drug Product manufacture and release; manage preclinical safety and efficacy studies; and develop and integrate regulatory documents for submission of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA); in support of an investigative clinical trial. Project 1 will establish the manufacturing methodology for the new product and help define an accelerated development path towards demonstration of clinical efficacy and product licensure. The novel active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of our microbicide is Griffithsin (GRFT); a marine algal natural protein for which we have developed and scaled an efficient recombinant manufacturing process. GRFT is the most potent HIV-1 entry inhibitor known and also has high activity against other viruses that may be co-transmitted with HIV; such as HSV-2. Through our collaborators in the PREVENT Program; we have produced more than 200 g of GRFT for research use; and developed effective and stable microbicide gel dosage forms. These prototype gels have been evaluated for initial safety in an ex vivo human explant system; physicochemical stability and API release characteristics with very encouraging results. In Aim 1 of this Project; we will apply methods we have successfully used to date to further optimize the API manufacturing process for maximum yield and recovery. The manufacturing process will be brought to compliance with FDA cGMP guidelines; together with supporting documentation. Compliant API will be used to cGMP manufacture the rectal gel final dosage form optimized in Core B. In Aim 2; the safety and tolerability of the rectal gel product will be determined in regulation-compliant toxicology in 3 animal species; with endpoints to include topical and systemic safety; tolerability; irritation; sensitivity and immunotoxicity. Preliminary Chemistry; Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) and safety information along with a draft clinical Protocol will be discussed with FDA in a pre-IND meeting. Agency feedback will assist us in finalizing an IND application; activation of which by FDA will allow us to initiate a first-in-humans clinical trial f the GRFT microbicide in Project 3.

This study will define the burden of acute sinusitis and identify children at greatest risk of developing sinusitis enabling the limitation of antimicrobial therapy. Ultimately; we will propose alternatives to antimicrobial agents in both prevention and treatment thereby decreasing antimicrobial resistance.

This symbiotic relationship has special significance for the young infant because the gut microbiota serve many protective and regulatory functions; prime immune responses; and can influence somatic; brain; and behavioral development. Several pediatric conditions have now been associated with either an atypical composition or abnormal levels of gut bacteria. Our project investigates how the maternal microbiota are transferred and established in the young infant; and the pathways through which gut bacteria and the enteric nervous system affect the developing central nervous system. State-of-the-art techniques will be employed to characterize the abundance; diversity and phylogeny of the gut microbiome community; and neuroimaging will be used to examine the normalcy of brain structure and myelination in the young infant.            ,NIMH,8749960,26-Jun-14,RFA-MH-14-080,1R21MH104198-01,1,R21,MH,104198,1,,"VICENTIC, ALEKSANDRA ",1-Jul-14,30-Jun-16,Special Emphasis Panel (ZMH1-ERB-M (04)),,1897969,"COE, CHRISTOPHER L.

This study will define the burden of acute sinusitis and identify children at greatest risk of developing sinusitis enabling the limitation of antimicrobial therapy. Ultimately; we will propose alternatives to antimicrobial agents in both prevention and treatment thereby decreasing antimicrobial resistance. These strategies will also impact on management of acute otitis media and acute bacterial pneumonia. Decreased antimicrobial use will provide a huge benefit to the public health.      ,NIAID,8588286,18-Nov-13,PA-10-067,5R01AI097172-03,5,R01,AI,97172,3,,"LU, KRISTINA ",1-Dec-11,30-Nov-16,Clinical Research and Field Studies of Infectious Diseases Study Section (CRFS) ,,7957535,"WALD, ELLEN ",Not Applicable,2,PEDIATRICS,161202122,US,43.068377,-89.40086,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,MADISON,WI,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,53715-1218,UNITED STATES, ,1-Dec-13,30-Nov-14,855,Research Projects,2014,NIAID,548826,170141,718967,

These studies will lead to a greater understanding of the development and progression of NAFLD and may lead to novel approaches for the treatment of a disease that is becoming an increasing public health concern.         ,NIDDK,8543716,16-Aug-13,PAR-09-247,5R01DK088831-02,5,R01,DK,88831,2,,"KARP, ROBERT W",15-Sep-12,31-Aug-17,Special Emphasis Panel (ZDK1-GRB-6 (O3)),,1868935,"SALZMAN, NITA H ","BORECKI, INGRID BERNADETTE",5,PEDIATRICS,937639060,US,43.04575,-88.020374,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,MILWAUKEE,WI,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,53226-3548,UNITED STATES, ,1-Sep-13,31-Aug-14,847,Research Projects,2013,NIDDK,1269101,143008,1412109,

Understanding the associations between Clostridium difficile and other intestinal bacteria as a function of location in the intestinal trat should allow us to better control CDAD by designing prophylaxis or treatments that act by controlling the microbial environment around the pathogen.

Project Narrative In each of us; microbial cells outnumber our own cells by at least tenfold: our gut microbes encode a dynamic and potentially modifiable gene pool that provides enzymatic functions not encoded in our own genetic material; and much of what we consume; both beneficial and noxious; is encountered and processed by this metabolic organ. Increasing evidence demonstrates that variation in gut microbial community composition has far-reaching consequences for human health; but the factors that shape these communities are poorly understood. This proposal describes experiments to characterize a family of these factors: a group of largely uncharacterized compounds related to vitamin B{12} that are exchanged between human gut microbes; and that represent a component of our diet that could be tailored to maximize the contribution of gut microbial communities to human health.,NIDDK,8091285,12-Aug-11,PAR-09-060,5K01DK089121-03,5,K01,DK,89121,3,,"PODSKALNY, JUDITH M,",1-Jul-10,30-Jun-15,"Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases B Subcommittee (DDK) ",,9188627,"GOODMAN, ANDREW L",Not Applicable,3,MICROBIOLOGY/IMMUN/VIROLOGY,43207562,US,41.303164,-72.931644,YALE UNIVERSITY,NEW HAVEN,CT,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,06510-3209,UNITED STATES, ,1-Jul-11,30-Jun-12,847,Other Research-Related,2011,NIDDK,,,137759,

Project Narrative In each of us; microbial cells outnumber our own cells by at least tenfold: our gut microbes encode a dynamic and potentially modifiable gene pool that provides enzymatic functions not encoded in our own genetic material; and much of what we consume; both beneficial and noxious; is encountered and processed by this metabolic organ. Increasing evidence demonstrates that variation in gut microbial community composition has far-reaching consequences for human health; but the factors that shape these communities are poorly understood. This proposal describes experiments to characterize a family of these factors: a group of largely uncharacterized compounds related to vitamin B{12} that are exchanged between human gut microbes; and that represent a component of our diet that could be tailored to maximize the contribution of gut microbial communities to human health.,NIDDK,8703676,16-Jul-14,PAR-09-060,5K01DK089121-06,5,K01,DK,89121,6,,"PODSKALNY, JUDITH M,",1-Jul-10,30-Jun-15,"Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases B Subcommittee (DDK) ",,9188627,"GOODMAN, ANDREW L",Not Applicable,3,MICROBIOLOGY/IMMUN/VIROLOGY,43207562,US,41.303164,-72.931644,YALE UNIVERSITY,NEW HAVEN,CT,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,06510-3209,UNITED STATES, ,1-Jul-14,30-Jun-15,847,Other Research-Related,2014,NIDDK,84580,6766,91346,

Although the ENS is thus critical for life; it is also vulnerable to injury. The ability of the ENS tomaintain and repair itself and adapt to change is thus important; nevertheless; relatively little is known abouthow the ENS accomplishes these tasks. Serotonin is known to be an important signaling molecule in the gut;serving both as a hormone and as a neurotransmitter. We have recently uncovered evidence that serotoninacts; in addition; to promote the survival of adult enteric neurons and their generation from stem cells.Serotonin also appears to be necessary for the maintenance of the subset of enteric neurons that usedopamine as their transmitter and has the further ability to promote intestinal inflammation. We now proposeto test the hypotheses that there are two functional serotonin pools that defend the gut. One is a large poolsynthesized by tryptophan hydroxylase1 (TpH1) that promotes inflammation; in part; to counter microbialinvasion from the gut lumen and the other is a small neuronal serotonin pool; synthesized by TpH2; whichprotects neurons from inflammation and other causes of injury. We will now test these hypotheses with gain-of-function and loss-of-function models in which critical molecules have genetically been deleted in mice. Wewill also analyze the cellular receptors and signals through which the associated actions of serotonin aremediated. This work is relevant to the pathogenesis and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease; irritablebowel syndrome; and also to the disabling intestinal manifestations of Parkinson's disease.)""",NINDS,7757016,19-Apr-09,PA-07-070,2R01NS012969-34,2,R01,NS,12969,34,,"MITLER, MERRILL ",1-Dec-77,30-Apr-13,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-DKUS-F (02)),,1862707,"GERSHON, MICHAEL D",Not Applicable,13,PATHOLOGY,621889815,US,40.841253,-73.940404,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,NEW YORK,NY,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,10032-0049,UNITED STATES, ,1-May-09,30-Apr-10,853,Research Projects,2009,NINDS,,,350656,

Although the ENS is thus critical for life; it is also vulnerable to injury. The ability of the ENS tomaintain and repair itself and adapt to change is thus important; nevertheless; relatively little is known abouthow the ENS accomplishes these tasks. Serotonin is known to be an important signaling molecule in the gut;serving both as a hormone and as a neurotransmitter. We have recently uncovered evidence that serotoninacts; in addition; to promote the survival of adult enteric neurons and their generation from stem cells.Serotonin also appears to be necessary for the maintenance of the subset of enteric neurons that usedopamine as their transmitter and has the further ability to promote intestinal inflammation. We now proposeto test the hypotheses that there are two functional serotonin pools that defend the gut. One is a large poolsynthesized by tryptophan hydroxylase1 (TpH1) that promotes inflammation; in part; to counter microbialinvasion from the gut lumen and the other is a small neuronal serotonin pool; synthesized by TpH2; whichprotects neurons from inflammation and other causes of injury. We will now test these hypotheses with gain-of-function and loss-of-function models in which critical molecules have genetically been deleted in mice.

Clinical Research,2012,Immunology;Inflammation;Training Programs;,TRAINING PROGRAM IN IMMUNOLOGY AND INFLAMMATION,  Inflammation is a basic immunological mechanism that helps to protect the host from injury and infection under normal physiological conditions. Research conducted over the last 15 years has shown that chronic inflammation is a pervasive component in many human diseases; and yet the basic mechanisms underlying inflammatory processes and how they lead to disease remain largely unknown. The need to recruit and train a new generation of the brightest scientists to the study of immunology and inflammation will directly impact on our understanding of numerous diseases of public health import in which inflammation drives dysfunction of the immune system.         ,NIAID,8339004,21-Jun-12,PA-11-184,1T32AI100853-01,1,T32,AI,100853,1,,"PROGRAIS, LAWRENCE J.",1-Jul-12,30-Jun-17,Microbiology and Infectious Diseases B Subcommittee (MID) ,,2414009,"DUSTIN, MICHAEL LORAN",Not Applicable,12,PATHOLOGY,121911077,US,40.744985,-73.978118,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,NEW YORK,NY,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,10016-5802,UNITED STATES, ,1-Jul-12,30-Jun-13,855,Training; Institutional,2012,NIAID,183148,13116,196264,

Although the ENS is thus critical for life; it is also vulnerable to injury. The ability of the ENS tomaintain and repair itself and adapt to change is thus important; nevertheless; relatively little is known abouthow the ENS accomplishes these tasks. Serotonin is known to be an important signaling molecule in the gut;serving both as a hormone and as a neurotransmitter. We have recently uncovered evidence that serotoninacts; in addition; to promote the survival of adult enteric neurons and their generation from stem cells.Serotonin also appears to be necessary for the maintenance of the subset of enteric neurons that usedopamine as their transmitter and has the further ability to promote intestinal inflammation. We now proposeto test the hypotheses that there are two functional serotonin pools that defend the gut. One is a large poolsynthesized by tryptophan hydroxylase1 (TpH1) that promotes inflammation; in part; to counter microbialinvasion from the gut lumen and the other is a small neuronal serotonin pool; synthesized by TpH2; whichprotects neurons from inflammation and other causes of injury. We will now test these hypotheses with gain-of-function and loss-of-function models in which critical molecules have genetically been deleted in mice. Wewill also analyze the cellular receptors and signals through which the associated actions of serotonin aremediated. This work is relevant to the pathogenesis and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease; irritablebowel syndrome; and also to the disabling intestinal manifestations of Parkinson's disease.)""",NINDS,8247027,6-Mar-12,PA-07-070,5R01NS012969-37,5,R01,NS,12969,37,,"GNADT, JAMES W",1-Dec-77,30-Apr-13,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-DKUS-F (02)),,1862707,"GERSHON, MICHAEL D",Not Applicable,13,PATHOLOGY,621889815,US,40.841253,-73.940404,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,NEW YORK,NY,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,10032-0049,UNITED STATES, ,1-May-12,30-Apr-13,853,Research Projects,2012,NINDS,214375,130769,345144,

Clinical Research,2013,Immunology;Inflammation;Training Programs;,TRAINING PROGRAM IN IMMUNOLOGY AND INFLAMMATION,  Inflammation is a basic immunological mechanism that helps to protect the host from injury and infection under normal physiological conditions. Research conducted over the last 15 years has shown that chronic inflammation is a pervasive component in many human diseases; and yet the basic mechanisms underlying inflammatory processes and how they lead to disease remain largely unknown. The need to recruit and train a new generation of the brightest scientists to the study of immunology and inflammation will directly impact on our understanding of numerous diseases of public health import in which inflammation drives dysfunction of the immune system.         ,NIAID,8495260,17-May-13,PA-11-184,5T32AI100853-02,5,T32,AI,100853,2,,"PROGRAIS, LAWRENCE J.",1-Jul-12,30-Jun-17,Microbiology and Infectious Diseases B Subcommittee (MID) ,,1860668,"ERNST, JOEL D.",Not Applicable,12,PATHOLOGY,121911077,US,40.744985,-73.978118,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,NEW YORK,NY,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,10016-5802,UNITED STATES, ,1-Jul-13,30-Jun-14,855,Training; Institutional,2013,NIAID,183148,13116,196264,

While the gut microbiota is known to confer host resistance to invading pathogens; the mechanisms by which specific commensal bacteria confer protection against enteric pathogens have been difficult to elucidate due to the complex interactions between the host and its microbiota. This proposal describes the utilization of a Caenorhabditis elegans model system to investigate how specific commensal intestinal bacteria; such as Enterococcus faecium; can confer protection against gut pathogens such as Salmonella enterica. E. faecium is a normal member of the human intestinal microflora. Some strains are used as probiotics; but the specific mechanisms that enable to E. faecium colonize and protect various animals from infection are unknown. We demonstrate that E. faecium inhibition of Salmonella pathogenesis can be recapitulated in the C. elegans model. We will use this robust and efficient system to identify E. faecium factors that are required for protection ofC. elegans from infection by employing candidate-based mutation analysis and unbiased genetic screening approaches. Imaging of bacterial distribution and dynamics during host colonization; along with complementary biochemical and genetic approached; will allow the characterization of identified E. faecium mutants. The E. faecium mutants characterized from these C. elegans studies will then be evaluated in mouse models of inflammation and bacterial infection to identify conserved mechanisms of host colonization and protection. These studies will reveal important mechanisms of commensal bacteria interactions with animal hosts and should guide the development of improved and tailored probiotics for the treatment of human diseases.            ,NIGMS,8412902,7-Dec-12,RFA-GM-13-001,1R01GM103593-01,1,R01,GM,103593,1,,"SLEDJESKI, DARREN D.",1-Jan-13,31-Dec-16,Special Emphasis Panel (ZGM1-GDB-2 (MC)),,9076601,"HANG, HOWARD C",Not Applicable,12,BIOLOGY,71037113,US,40.762898,-73.95652,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,NEW YORK,NY,OTHER DOMESTIC HIGHER EDUCATION,10065-6399,UNITED STATES, ,1-Jan-13,31-Dec-13,859,Research Projects,2013,NIGMS,200000,139000,339000,

While developing nations are most susceptible; outbreaks of deadly food-borne illnesses; antibiotic resistant bacteria; the global HIV epidemic; and numerous emerging viruses poignantly illustrate the need to recruit and train the next generation of scientists to the study how bacteria; parasites; and viruses cause infectious diseases in humans so that new therapies and vaccines can be developed against rapidly changing microbes. This application proposes to educate trainees in basic microbiological mechanisms as these scientists continue to be of great importance to protect our nation and society at large against the continuing threat posed by infectious microbes around the world.         ,NIAID,8550475,5-Jun-13,PA-11-184,2T32AI007180-31,2,T32,AI,7180,31,,"ROBBINS, CHRISTIANE M.",1-Sep-79,30-Jun-18,Microbiology and Infectious Diseases B Subcommittee (MID) ,,1882984,"MOHR, IAN J.",Not Applicable,12,MICROBIOLOGY/IMMUN/VIROLOGY,121911077,US,40.744985,-73.978118,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,NEW YORK,NY,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,10016-5802,UNITED STATES, ,1-Jul-13,30-Jun-14,855,Training; Institutional,2013,NIAID,365772,21582,387354,

Gut and skin microbiota (the totality of microbes that reside in/on the human body) have long been thought to contribute to inflammatory diseases. This project will use new DNA technology and state-of-the-art computational analytical methods to identify the microbes living on the skin and in the intestine of patients with psoriasis and PsA; and has the potential to be truly transformative by filling a fundamental knowledge gap regarding the cause of inflammatory arthritis. The results could transform our understanding of the relationships between microbes and humans; and lead to innovative diagnostic tests and future treatments.          ,NIAMS,8487730,25-Feb-13,PA-11-194,1K23AR064318-01,1,K23,AR,64318,1,,"MAO, SU-YAU ",1-Apr-13,31-Mar-17,Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases Special Grants Review Committee (AMS) ,,10744643,"SCHER, JOSE U.",Not Applicable,12,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,121911077,US,40.744985,-73.978118,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,NEW YORK,NY,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,10016-5802,UNITED STATES, ,1-Apr-13,31-Mar-14,846,Other Research-Related,2013,NIAMS,126700,10136,136836,

Clinical Research,2014,Immunology;Inflammation;Training Programs;,TRAINING PROGRAM IN IMMUNOLOGY AND INFLAMMATION,  Inflammation is a basic immunological mechanism that helps to protect the host from injury and infection under normal physiological conditions. Research conducted over the last 15 years has shown that chronic inflammation is a pervasive component in many human diseases; and yet the basic mechanisms underlying inflammatory processes and how they lead to disease remain largely unknown. The need to recruit and train a new generation of the brightest scientists to the study of immunology and inflammation will directly impact on our understanding of numerous diseases of public health import in which inflammation drives dysfunction of the immune system.         ,NIAID,8663183,13-Jun-14,PA-11-184,5T32AI100853-03,5,T32,AI,100853,3,,"PROGRAIS, LAWRENCE J.",1-Jul-12,30-Jun-17,Microbiology and Infectious Diseases B Subcommittee (MID) ,,1860668,"ERNST, JOEL D.",Not Applicable,12,PATHOLOGY,121911077,US,40.744985,-73.978118,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,NEW YORK,NY,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,10016-5802,UNITED STATES, ,1-Jul-14,30-Jun-15,855,Training; Institutional,2014,NIAID,186338,13371,199524,

While the gut microbiota is known to confer host resistance to invading pathogens; the mechanisms by which specific commensal bacteria confer protection against enteric pathogens have been difficult to elucidate due to the complex interactions between the host and its microbiota. This proposal describes the utilization of a Caenorhabditis elegans model system to investigate how specific commensal intestinal bacteria; such as Enterococcus faecium; can confer protection against gut pathogens such as Salmonella enterica. E. faecium is a normal member of the human intestinal microflora. Some strains are used as probiotics; but the specific mechanisms that enable to E. faecium colonize and protect various animals from infection are unknown. We demonstrate that E. faecium inhibition of Salmonella pathogenesis can be recapitulated in the C. elegans model. We will use this robust and efficient system to identify E. faecium factors that are required for protection ofC. elegans from infection by employing candidate-based mutation analysis and unbiased genetic screening approaches. Imaging of bacterial distribution and dynamics during host colonization; along with complementary biochemical and genetic approached; will allow the characterization of identified E. faecium mutants. The E. faecium mutants characterized from these C. elegans studies will then be evaluated in mouse models of inflammation and bacterial infection to identify conserved mechanisms of host colonization and protection. These studies will reveal important mechanisms of commensal bacteria interactions with animal hosts and should guide the development of improved and tailored probiotics for the treatment of human diseases.            ,NIGMS,8594254,3-Feb-14,RFA-GM-13-001,5R01GM103593-02,5,R01,GM,103593,2,,"SLEDJESKI, DARREN D.",1-Jan-13,31-Dec-16,Special Emphasis Panel (ZGM1-GDB-2 (MC)),,9076601,"HANG, HOWARD C",Not Applicable,12,BIOLOGY,71037113,US,40.762898,-73.95652,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,NEW YORK,NY,OTHER DOMESTIC HIGHER EDUCATION,10065-6399,UNITED STATES, ,1-Jan-14,31-Dec-14,859,Research Projects,2014,NIGMS,200000,139000,339000,

While developing nations are most susceptible; outbreaks of deadly food-borne illnesses; antibiotic resistant bacteria; the global HIV epidemic; and numerous emerging viruses poignantly illustrate the need to recruit and train the next generation of scientists to the study how bacteria; parasites; and viruses cause infectious diseases in humans so that new therapies and vaccines can be developed against rapidly changing microbes. This application proposes to educate trainees in basic microbiological mechanisms as these scientists continue to be of great importance to protect our nation and society at large against the continuing threat posed by infectious microbes around the world.         ,NIAID,8672579,18-Jun-14,PA-11-184,5T32AI007180-32,5,T32,AI,7180,32,,"ROBBINS, CHRISTIANE M.",1-Sep-79,30-Jun-18,Microbiology and Infectious Diseases B Subcommittee (MID) ,,1882984,"MOHR, IAN J.",Not Applicable,12,MICROBIOLOGY/IMMUN/VIROLOGY,121911077,US,40.744985,-73.978118,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,NEW YORK,NY,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,10016-5802,UNITED STATES, ,1-Jul-14,30-Jun-15,855,Training; Institutional,2014,NIAID,369620,21890,301803,

Gut and skin microbiota (the totality of microbes that reside in/on the human body) have long been thought to contribute to inflammatory diseases. This project will use new DNA technology and state-of-the-art computational analytical methods to identify the microbes living on the skin and in the intestine of patients with psoriasis and PsA; and has the potential to be truly transformative by filling a fundamental knowledge gap regarding the cause of inflammatory arthritis. The results could transform our understanding of the relationships between microbes and humans; and lead to innovative diagnostic tests and future treatments.          ,NIAMS,8626362,25-Mar-14,PA-11-194,5K23AR064318-02,5,K23,AR,64318,2,,"MAO, SU-YAU ",1-Apr-13,31-Mar-17,Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases Special Grants Review Committee (AMS) ,,10744643,"SCHER, JOSE U.",Not Applicable,12,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,121911077,US,40.744985,-73.978118,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,NEW YORK,NY,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,10016-5802,UNITED STATES, ,1-Apr-14,31-Mar-15,846,Other Research-Related,2014,NIAMS,126700,10136,136836,

There are no pharmacological therapies today that will prevent disease progression or reduce mortality once COPD is established. In advanced disease; increased bacterial colonization of the airways has been associated with disease progression.

Intestinal inflammatory disorders; such as necrotizing enterocolitis or Crohn's Disease; can result from exaggerated immune responses; however; it is unclear whether microbiome shifts precede inflammation; or are a consequence of it.

It is caused by bacteria; but there are so many species in the mouth; many of them uncultured; that it has been difficult to figure out which ones cause disease and how different microbes interact and lead to heath or disease. The proposed studies will use microbial genomic information and advanced microbiological techniques to culture novel microbes and communities and to learn which bacteria are important so that ways to prevent and treat disease may be developed.             ,NIDCR,8736418,22-Jul-14,RFA-DE-14-003,1R01DE024463-01,1,R01,DE,24463,1,,"LUNSFORD, DWAYNE ",1-Aug-14,31-Jul-19,Special Emphasis Panel (ZDE1-JR (27)),,9342986,"PODAR, MIRCEA  ","JOULINE, IGOR B.;LEYS, EUGENE J",3,Unavailable,99114287,US,35.963777,-84.293857,"UT-BATTELLE, LLC-OAK RIDGE NATIONAL LAB",OAK RIDGE,TN,Unavailable,37831-2008,UNITED STATES, ,1-Aug-14,31-Jul-15,121,Research Projects,2014,NIDCR,1092503,545178,1637681,

Moreover; compared to RA in women; RA in men (the demographic most commonly treated in the VA) leads to greater morbidity and worse disease-related outcomes. Previous work from our group has shown that male Veterans with RA experience more than twice the mortality as age-matched men from the general population. Risk factors for RA; including both cigarette smoking and periodontitis (PD); are both highly prevalent in the VA population (the latter affecting ~8 of every 10 U.S. Veterans). Preliminary data suggest that these factors may directly influence the development of autoimmunity in RA. This work will explore the links of between environmental exposures; autoantibody development; and disease progression in RA. Results from this work will lead to an improved understanding of RA risk and may provide insight into new approaches of disease treatment and prevention.            ,VA,8633136,21-Feb-14,RFA-CX-13-001,1I01CX000896-01A1,1,I01,VA,896,1,A1,Unavailable,1-Jan-14,31-Dec-17,Immunology A (IMMA) ,,7332065,"MIKULS, TED RICHARD",Not Applicable,2,Unavailable,844360367,US,41.245056,-95.974709,OMAHA VA  MEDICAL CENTER,OMAHA,NE,Unavailable,68105-1850,UNITED STATES, ,1-Jan-14,31-Dec-14,999,Research Projects,2014,,,,,

Although it is known that the microbial communities of the exposed tooth surface play a critical role in caries formation; littleis known about the communities associated with hyposalivation and their role in atypical caries formation; especially on a tooth-specific basis. We propose to study two of the most common causes of hyposalivation; medication use and the autoimmune condition; Sj?gren's Syndrome; in order to define and characterize; for the first time; changes in supragingival microbial communities at multiple spatial and temporal scales in acute and chronic states of hyposalivation; and to develop new diagnostic and prognostic markers for hyposalivation-associated caries.            ,NIDCR,8579781,5-Jun-13,PA-11-260,1R01DE023113-01A1,1,R01,DE,23113,1,A1,"MELILLO, AMANDA A",1-Jul-13,30-Jun-18,"Oral, Dental and Craniofacial Sciences Study Section (ODCS) ",,1969635,"RELMAN, DAVID A.",Not Applicable,18,Unavailable,624218814,US,37.40457,-122.145003,PALO ALTO VETERANS INSTIT FOR RESEARCH,PALO ALTO,CA,Unavailable,94304-1207,UNITED STATES, ,1-Jul-13,30-Jun-14,121,Research Projects,2013,NIDCR,501292,156095,657387,

We propose an ambitious study in which we will monitor the microbial communities of healthy humans before; during and after several types of planned disturbance; and discover community features that predict future stability or future recovery from disturbance; with the expectation that our findings will fundamentally change the practice of medicine.                     ,NIAID,8741929,5-Aug-14,RFA-RM-12-017,5R01AI112401-02,5,R01,AI,112401,2,,"DUGAN, VIVIEN G.",25-Sep-13,31-Aug-18,Special Emphasis Panel (),,1969635,"RELMAN, DAVID A.

Although it is known that the microbial communities of the exposed tooth surface play a critical role in caries formation; littleis known about the communities associated with hyposalivation and their role in atypical caries formation; especially on a tooth-specific basis. We propose to study two of the most common causes of hyposalivation; medication use and the autoimmune condition; Sj?gren's Syndrome; in order to define and characterize; for the first time; changes in supragingival microbial communities at multiple spatial and temporal scales in acute and chronic states of hyposalivation; and to develop new diagnostic and prognostic markers for hyposalivation-associated caries.            ,NIDCR,8672626,24-Jun-14,PA-11-260,5R01DE023113-02,5,R01,DE,23113,2,,"MELILLO, AMANDA A",1-Jul-13,30-Jun-18,"Oral, Dental and Craniofacial Sciences Study Section (ODCS) ",,1969635,"RELMAN, DAVID A.",Not Applicable,18,Unavailable,624218814,US,37.40457,-122.145003,PALO ALTO VETERANS INSTIT FOR RESEARCH,PALO ALTO,CA,Unavailable,94304-1207,UNITED STATES, ,1-Jul-14,30-Jun-15,121,Research Projects,2014,NIDCR,491956,141581,633537,

Traditionally; studies attempting to gain insight into this problem have been performed in the laboratory using model systems and conditions that imperfectly mimic the human host. Here; we propose to directly measure the chemistry; structure and metabolic activity of pathogens in situ using a novel suite of approaches.         ,NHLBI,8682825,20-Jun-14,RFA-RM-11-006,5R01HL117328-03,5,R01,HL,117328,3,,"CALER, ELISABET V",24-Sep-12,30-Jun-17,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-BCMB-A (51)),,2115991,"NEWMAN, DIANNE K",Not Applicable,29,NONE,9584210,US,34.134337,-118.126525,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,PASADENA,CA,SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES,91125-0001,UNITED STATES, ,1-Jul-14,30-Jun-15,310,Research Projects,2014,OD,250000,162500,412500,

We propose a multi-step hypothesis in which commensal bacteria induce differentiation of IL-17-producing cells through expression of IL-1 and IL-23. IL-17 induces expression of G-CSF; thereby promoting granulopoiesis; and inducing expression of lung anti-microbial genes. Interaction of apoptotic neutrophils with local mucosal phagocytes dampens IL-1 and IL-23 expression; thus exerting feedback control over granulopoiesis. Ablation of commensal bacteria in Cxcl5-/- mice impairs lung pathogen defense. Understanding these interactions will provide new approaches to infectious and inflammatory diseases of the lung.         ,NIAID,8439395,14-Mar-13,PA-11-260,1R01AI099479-01A1,1,R01,AI,99479,1,A1,"DONG, GANG ",15-Mar-13,28-Feb-18,"Lung Cellular, Molecular, and Immunobiology Study Section (LCMI) ",,1917581,"WORTHEN, GEORGE SCOTT",Not Applicable,2,Unavailable,73757627,US,39.946629,-75.196611,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,PHILADELPHIA,PA,Unavailable,19104-4318,UNITED STATES, ,15-Mar-13,28-Feb-14,855,Research Projects,2013,NIAID,235000,158625,393625,

Ultimately; the ability to measureintestinal oxygen levels and/or alter the gut microbiota by noninvasively altering hosttissue oxygenation may lead to the development of innovative therapeutic approaches inthe management of disease states associated with the gut microbiota such as IBD andClostdrium difficile colitis.,NIGMS,8412823,10-Dec-12,RFA-GM-13-001,1R01GM103591-01,1,R01,GM,103591,1,,"SLEDJESKI, DARREN D.",10-Dec-12,30-Nov-16,Special Emphasis Panel (ZGM1-GDB-2 (MC)),,1877201,"WU, GARY D",Not Applicable,2,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,42250712,US,39.952982,-75.192768,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,PHILADELPHIA,PA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,19104-6205,UNITED STATES, ,10-Dec-12,30-Nov-13,859,Research Projects,2013,NIGMS,199994,119996,319990,

We hypothesize that there is an important interaction between maternal stress and the maternal vaginal microbiome; and consequently the pup gut microbiome; with the potential to significantly affect offspring neurodevelopment through alterations in postnatal nutrient metabolism and absorption. Therefore; we will use our EPS model to examine changes and interactions between the vaginal and gut microbial diversity; pup metabolomics; and gene expression and epigenetic programming of the hypothalamus.            ,NIMH,8749104,8-Aug-14,RFA-MH-14-080,1R21MH104184-01,1,R21,MH,104184,1,,"DESMOND, NANCY L",8-Aug-14,31-Jul-16,Special Emphasis Panel (ZMH1-ERB-M (04)),,1886670,"BALE, TRACY L",Not Applicable,2,VETERINARY SCIENCES,42250712,US,39.952982,-75.192768,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,PHILADELPHIA,PA,SCHOOLS OF VETERINARY MEDICINE,19104-6205,UNITED STATES, ,8-Aug-14,31-Jul-15,242,Research Projects,2014,NIMH,174999,104999,279998,

We propose a multi-step hypothesis in which commensal bacteria induce differentiation of IL-17-producing cells through expression of IL-1 and IL-23. IL-17 induces expression of G-CSF; thereby promoting granulopoiesis; and inducing expression of lung anti-microbial genes. Interaction of apoptotic neutrophils with local mucosal phagocytes dampens IL-1 and IL-23 expression; thus exerting feedback control over granulopoiesis. Ablation of commensal bacteria in Cxcl5-/- mice impairs lung pathogen defense. Understanding these interactions will provide new approaches to infectious and inflammatory diseases of the lung.         ,NIAID,8636398,5-Feb-14,PA-11-260,5R01AI099479-02,5,R01,AI,99479,2,,"DONG, GANG ",15-Mar-13,28-Feb-18,"Lung Cellular, Molecular, and Immunobiology Study Section (LCMI) ",,1917581,"WORTHEN, GEORGE SCOTT",Not Applicable,2,Unavailable,73757627,US,39.946629,-75.196611,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,PHILADELPHIA,PA,Unavailable,19104-4318,UNITED STATES, ,1-Mar-14,28-Feb-15,855,Research Projects,2014,NIAID,250000,168750,418750,

Pulmonary infections are a leading cause of mortality worldwide. They are also a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunosuppressed population which has grown with the increasing numbers of patients undergoing organ transplantation; receiving novel immunosuppressive therapies; or living with chronic HIV infection. In addition; the role that infections play in typically non-infectious lung diseases such as chronic obstructivepulmonary disease and asthma demonstrate that the impact of lung pathogens extends beyond acute pneumonia. Despite the global importance of lung infections; the development of new antibiotics; vaccines; and novel therapeutics has been slow. Emerging technologies are rapidly expanding diagnostic approaches and establishing new areas of research such as the role of the lung microbiome in pulmonary diseases. The 2013 Pittsburgh Lung Conference will highlight clinical care that affects treatment strategies and improves patient outcomes as well as research advances that will drive the development of new therapeutic and diagnostic approaches to lung infections. The conference brings together top scientists to advance this vital field while offerin an inclusive meeting that prioritizes involvement of junior scientists.

The expression of chemokines that cause inflammation is thought to contribute to the transmission of HIV-1. Anti-chemokine therapies that combat this inflammation could reduce the likelihood of HIV-1 transmission. Findings from these studies will improve our understanding of mucosal inflammation; anti-inflammatory therapies; and HIV-1 transmission; and could impact approaches to combating HIV-1 transmission.,NIAID,8724017,27-Aug-13,PA-11-260,1R56AI104713-01A1,1,R56,AI,104713,1,A1,"SANDERS, BRIGITTE E.",1-Sep-13,31-Aug-15,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-AARR-C (02)),,1941580,"REINHART, TODD A",Not Applicable,14,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,4514360,US,40.444001,-79.956102,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,PITTSBURGH,PA,SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH,15213-2303,UNITED STATES, ,1-Sep-13,31-Aug-15,855,Research Projects,2013,NIAID,479000,225473,704473,

We will investigate the roles of the fungal mycobiome in the lung and fungal translocation in HIV-associated COPD and elucidate the impact of chronic infections in perpetuating inflammation and pulmonary function decline.

Unfortunately; the causes of pancreatic cancer are largely unknown; but new studies support the role of bacteria. For this proposal; we propose to (1) measure microbiota in patients with pancreatic cancer; and in subjects who did not have cancer using a combination of state-of-the-art molecular techniques; (2) examine possible routes of bacteria dissemination from the mouth to the pancreas.                                 ,NCI,8582772,19-Jul-13,PA-11-158,1R01CA166150-01A1,1,R01,CA,166150,1,A1,"STARKS, VAURICE ",19-Jul-13,30-Jun-16,Epidemiology of Cancer Study Section (EPIC) ,,7899116,"MICHAUD, DOMINIQUE S ","IZARD, JACQUES G",1,PUBLIC HEALTH & PREV MEDICINE,1785542,US,41.828145,-71.401161,BROWN UNIVERSITY,PROVIDENCE,RI,SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH,02912-9002,UNITED STATES, ,19-Jul-13,30-Jun-14,393,Research Projects,2013,NCI,595882,117251,713133,

These factors are key components in C. albicans ability to cause oral and vaginal thrush; denture stomatitis; and systemic infection; especially in immune compromised individuals.         ,NIDCR,8707232,23-Jul-14,PA-11-111,5F31DE022701-03,5,F31,DE,22701,3,,"FRIEDEN, LESLIE A",1-Sep-12,31-Jan-15,NIDCR Special Grants Review Committee (DSR) ,,10631060,"JONES, STEPHEN KNOX",Not Applicable,1,BIOCHEMISTRY,1785542,US,41.828145,-71.401161,BROWN UNIVERSITY,PROVIDENCE,RI,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,02912-9002,UNITED STATES, ,1-Sep-14,31-Jan-15,121,Training; Individual,2014,NIDCR,18582,,18582,

Unfortunately; the causes of pancreatic cancer are largely unknown; but new studies support the role of bacteria. For this proposal; we propose to (1) measure microbiota in patients with pancreatic cancer; and in subjects who did not have cancer using a combination of state-of-the-art molecular techniques; (2) examine possible routes of bacteria dissemination from the mouth to the pancreas.,NCI,8704438,17-Jun-14,PA-11-158,5R01CA166150-02,5,R01,CA,166150,2,,"STARKS, VAURICE ",19-Jul-13,30-Jun-16,Epidemiology of Cancer Study Section (EPIC) ,,7899116,"MICHAUD, DOMINIQUE S ","IZARD, JACQUES G",1,PUBLIC HEALTH & PREV MEDICINE,1785542,US,41.828145,-71.401161,BROWN UNIVERSITY,PROVIDENCE,RI,SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH,02912-9002,UNITED STATES, ,1-Jul-14,30-Jun-15,393,Research Projects,2014,NCI,618103,83864,701967,

This will be tested by: (1) linking alcohol-induced changes in circulating metabolome to eicosanoids and to the activation status of pathways; and (2) defining the role of specific lipoxygenases by their suppression using pharmacologic and genetic knockdown methods in two complementary diet-induced mouse models of liver disease. When these studies are completed; novel information on how alcohol consumption modifies systemic LOX activity and the role of such changes in driving liver disease will be obtained.      ,NIAAA,8204326,22-Aug-11,RFA-AA-11-002,1R01AA020758-01,1,R01,AA,20758,1,,"MURRAY, GARY ",1-Sep-11,31-Jul-16,Special Emphasis Panel (ZAA1-JJ (01)),,1872381,"SANYAL, ARUN J",Not Applicable,3,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,105300446,US,37.539694,-77.428159,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,RICHMOND,VA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,23298-0568,UNITED STATES, ,1-Sep-11,31-Jul-12,273,Research Projects,2011,NIAAA,,,503279,

Secondary bile acids are more hydrophobic and toxic to mammalian cells than primary bile acids. Increased levels of DCA in blood; bile and feces have been correlated with an increase incidence of colon cancer and cholesterol gallstone disease; in some patients. The normal level of DCA in human bile is around 20% of the total bile acid pool. However; in a preliminary study of patients (92) at the McGuire VA Hospital in Richmond; Virginia; we found that approximately 50% of these patients had DCA between 30% and 70%; which is considered to be high levels of DCA. The studies proposed in this application are aimed at determining why this population of patients has high levels of DCA in bile and developing ways to monitor bile acid 7?-dehydroxylating gut bacteria in fecal samples.,VA,8698288,7-Feb-14,RFA-BX-11-014,5I01BX001328-03,5,I01,VA,1328,3,,Unavailable,1-Jul-12,30-Jun-16,Gastroenterology (GAST) ,,1888156,"HYLEMON, PHILLIP B",Not Applicable,3,Unavailable,146678115,US,37.529387,-77.47556,VA VETERANS ADMINISTRATION HOSPITAL,RICHMOND,VA,Unavailable,23249-0001,UNITED STATES, ,1-Jul-14,30-Jun-15,999,Research Projects,2014,,,,,

This will be tested by: (1) linking alcohol-induced changes in circulating metabolome to eicosanoids and to the activation status of pathways; and (2) defining the role of specific lipoxygenases by their suppression using pharmacologic and genetic knockdown methods in two complementary diet-induced mouse models of liver disease. When these studies are completed; novel information on how alcohol consumption modifies systemic LOX activity and the role of such changes in driving liver disease will be obtained.      ,NIAAA,8727960,14-Jul-14,RFA-AA-11-002,5R01AA020758-04,5,R01,AA,20758,4,,"OROSZ, ANDRAS ",1-Sep-11,31-Jul-16,Special Emphasis Panel (ZAA1-JJ (01)),,1872381,"SANYAL, ARUN J",Not Applicable,3,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,105300446,US,37.539694,-77.428159,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,RICHMOND,VA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,23298-0568,UNITED STATES, ,1-Aug-14,31-Jul-15,273,Research Projects,2014,NIAAA,324744,156862,481606,

If our hypotheses are proven correct; we can identify microbiomes that cause cancer and find ways to quantify that risk by using a combination of modern computational and sequencing techniques and attenuate that risk my manipulating the gut microbiome using antibiotics; probiotics; or prebiotics.

T1D is an autoimmune disease that occurs when a child's body cannot produce insulin; and genetics as well as environmental factors play a role in the development of this disease. We propose to study the complex interplay of environmental; immunological and genetic factors to discover molecular signatures with a potential to advance clinical diagnosis and therapy at or before the onset of T1D.      ,NIDDK,8241486,27-Sep-11,RFA-DK-10-012,1DP3DK094343-01,1,DP3,DK,94343,1,,"AKOLKAR, BEENA ",30-Sep-11,31-Aug-15,Special Emphasis Panel (ZDK1-GRB-J (O1)),,9369252,"MADUPU, RAMANA ",Not Applicable,6,Unavailable,76364392,US,39.09991,-77.195015,"J.

It occurs suddenly;usually during the first month of life; and we don't know how to prevent it. It is probably moredangerous to premature infants than lung disease today. About one-third of children die; and many ofthe survivors are left with very little intestines. NEC is a disorder that we think might relate to themicrobes in the gut. We propose to study this disease intensively; compare cases to controlsespecially in the days leading up to NEC; and try to determine what differentiates the patients who getthis disorder from those who don't.

Over the last year theanalysis of the microbiome of 250 healthy subjects was initiated; focusing on five body sites. This study began to builda catalog of genome sequences of organisms that inhabit the human body as well as described the diversity foundbetween body sites and individuals. The goal of this study is to add 1;000 genomes to the catalog of referencesequences of the human microbiome; to further characterize differences in the metagenomes of 250 individuals bydirectly comparing shotgun sequences; to characterize the virome component of the human microbiome; to take acensus of eukaryotic microbes in the human microbiome; and to analyze the transcriptional pattern found inmetagenomic communities. These studies will advance our growing knowledge of the human microbiome in healthysubjects; providing a baseline for disease studies as well as new tools for probing the microbiome.,NHGRI,7644627,21-May-09,RFA-RM-08-001,1U54HG004968-01,1,U54,HG,4968,1,,"PROCTOR, LITA ",22-May-09,30-Apr-13,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-GGG-J (52)),,1884959,"WEINSTOCK, GEORGE M",Not Applicable,2,GENETICS,68552207,US,38.647241,-90.300814,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,SAINT LOUIS,MO,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,63130-4862,UNITED STATES, ,22-May-09,30-Apr-10,310,Research Centers,2009,OD,,,8258835,

Project Narrative In each of us; microbial cells outnumber our own cells by at least tenfold: our gut microbes encode a dynamic and potentially modifiable gene pool that provides enzymatic functions not encoded in our own genetic material; and much of what we consume; both beneficial and noxious; is encountered and processed by this metabolic organ. Increasing evidence demonstrates that variation in gut microbial community composition has far-reaching consequences for human health; but the factors that shape these communities are poorly understood. This proposal describes experiments to characterize a family of these factors: a group of largely uncharacterized compounds related to vitamin B12 that are exchanged between human gut microbes; and that represent a component of our diet that could be tailored to maximize the contribution of gut microbial communities to human health.,NIDDK,7963561,14-Jun-10,PAR-09-060,1K01DK089121-01,1,K01,DK,89121,1,,"PODSKALNY, JUDITH M,",1-Jul-10,31-Dec-10,"Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases B Subcommittee (DDK) ",,9188627,"GOODMAN, ANDREW L",Not Applicable,2,PATHOLOGY,68552207,US,38.647241,-90.300814,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,SAINT LOUIS,MO,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,63130-4862,UNITED STATES, ,1-Jul-10,31-Dec-10,847,Other Research-Related,2010,NIDDK,,,47851,

It occurs suddenly; usually during the first month of life; and we don't know how to prevent it. It is probably more dangerous to premature infants than lung disease today.

Over the last year theanalysis of the microbiome of 250 healthy subjects was initiated; focusing on five body sites. This study began to builda catalog of genome sequences of organisms that inhabit the human body as well as described the diversity foundbetween body sites and individuals. The goal of this study is to add 1;000 genomes to the catalog of referencesequences of the human microbiome; to further characterize differences in the metagenomes of 250 individuals bydirectly comparing shotgun sequences; to characterize the virome component of the human microbiome; to take acensus of eukaryotic microbes in the human microbiome; and to analyze the transcriptional pattern found inmetagenomic communities.

The nutritional value of food is not an absolute entity; but rather is influenced in part by the collection of microbes present in our intestines. This grant uses methods based on a revolutionary new field of microbiology; known as metagenomics; plus mice colonized with members of the human gut microbial community; to determine whether components of this community known as hydrogen consumers play a key role in shaping how our gut functions to extract nutrients and energy from the food we eat. The proposed experiments should help develop new ways for assessing our nutritional status; for making nutritional recommendations; and for determining whether deliberate manipulation of the representation or metabolic activities of these hydrogen-consuming gut microbes will provide a safe and effective way for treating and preventing obesity.) ),NIDDK,8090256,9-Jun-11,PA-07-070,5R01DK070977-07,5,R01,DK,70977,7,,"KARP, ROBERT W",1-Aug-05,31-May-15,Gastrointestinal Mucosal Pathobiology Study Section (GMPB) ,,2410065,"GORDON, JEFFREY I",Not Applicable,2,PATHOLOGY,68552207,US,38.647241,-90.300814,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,SAINT LOUIS,MO,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,63130-4862,UNITED STATES, ,1-Jun-11,31-May-12,847,Research Projects,2011,NIDDK,,,323532,

Of special importance; macaques are used to study AIDS since infection of these animals with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) mimics infection of people with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV). One of the most common diseases seen in both SIV-infected and uninfected macaques is diarrhea- but the causes of this are not completely understood. In addition; it now appears that intestinal damage in SIV-infected macaques may contribute to the development of AIDS via release of materials from the lumen of the intestine into the circulation that stimulate the immune system. Thus there are important unknowns about enteric viruses and bacteria that; if answered; could improve macaque health and disease diagnosis; and perhaps also shed light on the progression of SIV infection. We approached this problem using next-generation sequencing and new computational methods to define the bacteria and viruses (microbiome and virome) present in the macaque intestine. Remarkably we discovered more than 19 new enteric viruses; mostly present in SIV-infected macaques that progress rapidly to AIDS. Our data also suggest that SIV progression to AIDS is accompanied by substantial changes in the microbiome and the virome- these might well contribute to intestinal damage and diarrheal disease. This proposal is to study the macaque microbiome and virome in health and disease. We expect to develop a better understanding of the viruses; and changes in bacterial populations; that cause disease in macaques; to develop new diagnostic tests whose application will improve macaque health; and to leverage these cutting edge sequencing and computational methods to better understand AIDS.      ,NCRR,8137528,22-Aug-11,RFA-RR-10-005,1R01RR032309-01,1,R01,RR,32309,1,,"MORO, MANUEL H",1-Sep-11,30-Jun-15,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRR1-CM-4 (01)),,1861917,"VIRGIN, HERBERT W ","BAROUCH, DAN H.",2,PATHOLOGY,68552207,US,38.647241,-90.300814,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,SAINT LOUIS,MO,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,63130-4862,UNITED STATES, ,1-Sep-11,30-Jun-12,389,Research Projects,2011,NCRR,,,805927,

Over the last year the analysis of the microbiome of 250 healthy subjects was initiated; focusing on five body sites. This study began to build a catalog of genome sequences of organisms that inhabit the human body as well as described the diversity found between body sites and individuals. The goal of this study is to add 1;000 genomes to the catalog of reference sequences of the human microbiome; to further characterize differences in the metagenomes of 250 individuals by directly comparing shotgun sequences; to characterize the virome component of the human microbiome; to take a census of eukaryotic microbes in the human microbiome; and to analyze the transcriptional pattern found in metagenomic communities.

The nutritional value of food is not an absolute entity; but rather is influenced in part by the collection of microbes present in our intestines. This grant uses methods based on a revolutionary new field of microbiology; known as metagenomics; plus mice colonized with members of the human gut microbial community; to determine whether components of this community known as hydrogen consumers play a key role in shaping how our gut functions to extract nutrients and energy from the food we eat.

Of special importance; macaques are used to study AIDS since infection of these animals with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) mimics infection of people with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV). One of the most common diseases seen in both SIV-infected and uninfected macaques is diarrhea- but the causes of this are not completely understood. In addition; it now appears that intestinal damage in SIV-infected macaques may contribute to the development of AIDS via release of materials from the lumen of the intestine into the circulation that stimulate the immune system. Thus there are important unknowns about enteric viruses and bacteria that; if answered; could improve macaque health and disease diagnosis; and perhaps also shed light on the progression of SIV infection. We approached this problem using next-generation sequencing and new computational methods to define the bacteria and viruses (microbiome and virome) present in the macaque intestine. Remarkably we discovered more than 19 new enteric viruses; mostly present in SIV-infected macaques that progress rapidly to AIDS. Our data also suggest that SIV progression to AIDS is accompanied by substantial changes in the microbiome and the virome- these might well contribute to intestinal damage and diarrheal disease. This proposal is to study the macaque microbiome and virome in health and disease. We expect to develop a better understanding of the viruses; and changes in bacterial populations; that cause disease in macaques; to develop new diagnostic tests whose application will improve macaque health; and to leverage these cutting edge sequencing and computational methods to better understand AIDS.      ,OD,8323267,13-Jun-12,RFA-RR-10-005,8R01OD011170-02,8,R01,OD,11170,2,,"MORO, MANUEL H",1-Sep-11,30-Jun-15,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRR1-CM-4 (01)),,1861917,"VIRGIN, HERBERT W ","BAROUCH, DAN H.",2,PATHOLOGY,68552207,US,38.647241,-90.300814,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,SAINT LOUIS,MO,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,63130-4862,UNITED STATES, ,1-Jul-12,30-Jun-13,351,Research Projects,2012,OD,618509,153442,771951,

The nutritional value of food is not an absolute entity; but rather is influenced in part by the collection of microbes present in our intestines. This grant uses methods based on a revolutionary new field of microbiology; known as metagenomics; plus mice colonized with members of the human gut microbial community; to determine whether components of this community known as hydrogen consumers play a key role in shaping how our gut functions to extract nutrients and energy from the food we eat. The proposed experiments should help develop new ways for assessing our nutritional status; for making nutritional recommendations; and for determining whether deliberate manipulation of the representation or metabolic activities of these hydrogen-consuming gut microbes will provide a safe and effective way for treating and preventing obesity.,NIDDK,8470627,17-Jun-13,PA-07-070,5R01DK070977-09,5,R01,DK,70977,9,,"KARP, ROBERT W",1-Aug-05,31-May-15,Gastrointestinal Mucosal Pathobiology Study Section (GMPB) ,,2410065,"GORDON, JEFFREY I",Not Applicable,2,PATHOLOGY,68552207,US,38.647241,-90.300814,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,SAINT LOUIS,MO,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,63130-4862,UNITED STATES, ,1-Jun-13,31-May-14,847,Research Projects,2013,NIDDK,205400,106808,312208,

Of special importance; macaques are used to study AIDS since infection of these animals with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) mimics infection of people with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV). One of the most common diseases seen in both SIV-infected and uninfected macaques is diarrhea- but the causes of this are not completely understood. In addition; it now appears that intestinal damage in SIV-infected macaques may contribute to the development of AIDS via release of materials from the lumen of the intestine into the circulation that stimulate the immune system. Thus there are important unknowns about enteric viruses and bacteria that; if answered; could improve macaque health and disease diagnosis; and perhaps also shed light on the progression of SIV infection. We approached this problem using next-generation sequencing and new computational methods to define the bacteria and viruses (microbiome and virome) present in the macaque intestine. Remarkably we discovered more than 19 new enteric viruses; mostly present in SIV-infected macaques that progress rapidly to AIDS. Our data also suggest that SIV progression to AIDS is accompanied by substantial changes in the microbiome and the virome- these might well contribute to intestinal damage and diarrheal disease. This proposal is to study the macaque microbiome and virome in health and disease. We expect to develop a better understanding of the viruses; and changes in bacterial populations; that cause disease in macaques; to develop new diagnostic tests whose application will improve macaque health; and to leverage these cutting edge sequencing and computational methods to better understand AIDS.      ,OD,8488514,1-Aug-13,RFA-RR-10-005,5R01OD011170-03,5,R01,OD,11170,3,,"MORO, MANUEL H",1-Sep-11,30-Jun-15,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRR1-CM-4 (01)),,1861917,"VIRGIN, HERBERT W ","BAROUCH, DAN H.",2,PATHOLOGY,68552207,US,38.647241,-90.300814,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,SAINT LOUIS,MO,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,63130-4862,UNITED STATES, ,1-Jul-13,30-Jun-14,351,Research Projects,2013,OD,582244,143500,725744,

Of special importance; macaques are used to study AIDS since infection of these animals with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) mimics infection of people with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV). One of the most common diseases seen in both SIV-infected and uninfected macaques is diarrhea- but the causes of this are not completely understood. In addition; it now appears that intestinal damage in SIV-infected macaques may contribute to the development of AIDS via release of materials from the lumen of the intestine into the circulation that stimulate the immune system. Thus there are important unknowns about enteric viruses and bacteria that; if answered; could improve macaque health and disease diagnosis; and perhaps also shed light on the progression of SIV infection. We approached this problem using next-generation sequencing and new computational methods to define the bacteria and viruses (microbiome and virome) present in the macaque intestine. Remarkably we discovered more than 19 new enteric viruses; mostly present in SIV-infected macaques that progress rapidly to AIDS. Our data also suggest that SIV progression to AIDS is accompanied by substantial changes in the microbiome and the virome- these might well contribute to intestinal damage and diarrheal disease. This proposal is to study the macaque microbiome and virome in health and disease. We expect to develop a better understanding of the viruses; and changes in bacterial populations; that cause disease in macaques; to develop new diagnostic tests whose application will improve macaque health; and to leverage these cutting edge sequencing and computational methods to better understand AIDS.      ,OD,8711583,30-Jun-14,RFA-RR-10-005,5R01OD011170-04,5,R01,OD,11170,4,,"MORO, MANUEL H",1-Sep-11,30-Jun-15,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRR1-CM-4 (01)),,1861917,"VIRGIN, HERBERT W ","BAROUCH, DAN H.",2,PATHOLOGY,68552207,US,38.647241,-90.300814,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,SAINT LOUIS,MO,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,63130-4862,UNITED STATES, ,1-Jul-14,30-Jun-15,351,Research Projects,2014,OD,605705,148227,753932,

This research will lead to improved understanding of the impact of HSV-2 on vaginal bacteria and inflammation; and will help us realize the tools needed to better promote women's reproductive health.         ,NIAID,8510889,31-Jul-12,PA-11-260,1R56AI101101-01,1,R56,AI,101101,1,,"DAVID, HAGIT S.",1-Aug-12,31-Jul-14,Clinical Research and Field Studies of Infectious Diseases Study Section (CRFS) ,,9220124,"JOHNSTON, CHRISTINE MICHELLE",Not Applicable,7,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,605799469,US,47.660049,-122.31441,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,SEATTLE,WA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,98195-9472,UNITED STATES, ,1-Aug-12,31-Jul-14,855,Research Projects,2012,NIAID,474279,129374,603653,

Therefore; these microbes may be important contributors to diseases in which nutrients are poorly absorbed; the gastrointestinal tract is diseased; and/or the host grows poorly. The aim of this project is to determine the role of gastrointestinal microbes in the relentless and difficult-to-treat growth failure in children with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis; with the hope of both identifying interventions that will lead to better nutritional outcomes in these and in other children with poo early growth.         ,NIDDK,8815576,18-Sep-14,PAR-12-265,1R01DK095869-01A1,1,R01,DK,95869,1,A1,"EGGERMAN, THOMAS L",22-Sep-14,31-Aug-19,Special Emphasis Panel (ZDK1-GRB-C (O2)),,1892021,"HOFFMAN, LUCAS R.

The relationship between nutrition and immunityhas been a topic of study for more than five decades; however; surprisingly little is known regarding the impact of nutrition on the mucosal immune system of the digestive tract; a system that functions almost independently from the systemic immune apparatus and that is likely to play a key role in responses to many vaccines.

Conventional risk assessment does not place emphasis on the possible microbiome interactions with ingested environmental contaminants; instead relying upon universal dose-response curves. We propose to characterize the effects of chronically ingested arsenic on the gut microbiome; and vice-versa; laying groundwork for the novel field of microbiome-based risk assessment and informing future treatments and interventions in affected communities both in the U.S. and worldwide.         ,NIEHS,8596363,23-Aug-13,PA-11-112,1F31ES023293-01,1,F31,ES,23293,1,,"CHADWICK, LISA ",1-Sep-13,31-Aug-16,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-F13-C (20)),,11495228,"BACHAS-DAUNERT, STEPHANIE ",Not Applicable,18,MICROBIOLOGY/IMMUN/VIROLOGY,9214214,US,37.429038,-122.178178,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,STANFORD,CA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,94304-1222,UNITED STATES, ,1-Sep-13,31-Aug-14,113,Training; Individual,2013,NIEHS,42232,,42232,

Conventional risk assessment does not place emphasis on the possible microbiome interactions with ingested environmental contaminants; instead relying upon universal dose-response curves. We propose to characterize the effects of chronically ingested arsenic on the gut microbiome; and vice-versa; laying groundwork for the novel field of microbiome-based risk assessment and informing future treatments and interventions in affected communities both in the U.S. and worldwide.         ,NIEHS,8764644,27-Aug-14,PA-11-112,5F31ES023293-02,5,F31,ES,23293,2,,"CHADWICK, LISA ",1-Sep-13,31-Aug-16,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-F13-C (20)),,11495228,"BACHAS-DAUNERT, STEPHANIE ",Not Applicable,18,MICROBIOLOGY/IMMUN/VIROLOGY,9214214,US,37.429038,-122.178178,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,STANFORD,CA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,94304-1222,UNITED STATES, ,1-Sep-14,31-Aug-15,113,Training; Individual,2014,NIEHS,42676,,42676,

Idiopathic and infectious complications of HSCT are a major source of post-transplantation; non-relapse-associated morbidity and mortality.

Prevention requires effective risk assessment; which also lays the groundwork for intervention design and treatment. The intent is to hypothesize that differences in the structure and function of the human gut microbiota contribute to the observed differences in presence/absence of arsenicosis; given the same As environmental exposure and ingestion through groundwater and rice; and propose to address this hypothesis by examining the effect of As on fecal microbial communities in laboratory bioreactors; and by characterizing variation in taxonomic composition and functional potential of the gut microbiota of arsenic-exposed individuals in Bangladesh with and without arsenicosis; with the goal of microbiome-related risk assessment.            ,NIEHS,8606066,9-Jul-14,RFA-ES-12-009,1R21ES023387-01,1,R21,ES,23387,1,,"CHADWICK, LISA ",15-Jul-14,30-Jun-17,Special Emphasis Panel (ZES1-JAB-J (MB)),,1969635,"RELMAN, DAVID A.",Not Applicable,18,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,9214214,US,37.429038,-122.178178,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,STANFORD,CA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,94304-1222,UNITED STATES, ,15-Jul-14,30-Jun-15,113,Research Projects,2014,NIEHS,200000,118425,318425,

VERSUS MICROBIOTA,PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is growing appreciation that the host microbiome can have profound effects on health and susceptibility to disease; but few model systems in which to study the details of interactions between invading pathogens and resident microbiota. We have recently shown that Bordetella pertussis; which causes whooping cough in humans; poorly colonizes the respiratory tracts of mice because of competition with resident microflora; while the closely related B. bronchiseptica is able to efficiently colonize mice; displacing the residentmicroflora in the process. This application seeks to understand the ecological mechanisms behind how resident microorganisms inhibit B. pertussis colonization and the molecular mechanisms by which B. bronchiseptica eliminates them.,NIAID,8896095,1-Aug-14,PA-11-260,1R56AI107016-01A1,1,R56,AI,107016,1,A1,"LU, KRISTINA ",1-Aug-14,31-Jul-15,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-IDM-M (03)),,1942525,"HARVILL, ERIC T.",Not Applicable,5,VETERINARY SCIENCES,3403953,US,40.809096,-77.864287,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,UNIVERSITY PARK,PA,SCHOOLS OF  EARTH SCIENCES/NATURAL RESOURCES,16802-7000,UNITED STATES, ,1-Aug-14,31-Jul-15,855,Research Projects,2014,NIAID,250000,126750,376750,

Unfortunately; several large late phasetrials of HIV microbicides have failed for unknown reasons; with the research subjectsusing the microbicides having rates of HIV transmission higher than subjects usingplacebos. We hypothesize that one factor contributing to the failure of the microbicides isthat their use produces a harmful change in the microbial flora living in the vagina; whchleads to inflammation or activation of the cells that HIV replicates in; increasing the risksof HIV transmission. In our study; we propose to use new molecular biologicaltechniques to comprehensively catalog essentially all of the microbes living in the vaginaand determine how the use of HIV microbicides alters the population of the microbes.Determining that the use of HIV microbicides lead to a significant; potentially harmfulalteration in the population of vaginal flora would help explain the failure of the existingmicrobicides to prevent HIV transmission and may help enable the development of new;more effect HIV microbicides.,NIAID,8143349,5-Aug-11,RFA-AI-07-034,5R33AI079798-04,5,R33,AI,79798,4,,"VERONESE, FULVIA D.",5-Sep-08,31-Aug-13,Special Emphasis Panel (ZAI1-MMT-A (M2)),,1905018,"ZEICHNER, STEVEN L ","RAVEL, JACQUES ",98,Unavailable,143983562,US,38.92636,-77.012376,CHILDREN'S RESEARCH INSTITUTE,WASHINGTON,DC,Unavailable,20010-2916,UNITED STATES, ,1-Sep-11,31-Aug-12,855,Research Projects,2011,NIAID,,,438570,

The NIH funded human microbiome project has revealed the diversity of microorganisms that live in close association in and on the human body. They contribute to the health not only by preventing pathogenic bacteria from colonizing but by providing essential nutrients; stimulating the immune system and influencing the development. The goal of the 2012 meeting will be to emphasis on how metagenomics; metabolomics; and computational biology and modeling can be used to better understand host-microbe interactions. Understanding the role of microbes in health is critical to understand how disturbing the microbiome can lead to disease.         ,NIGMS,8399967,12-Sep-12,PA-10-071,1R13GM103179-01,1,R13,GM,103179,1,,"SLEDJESKI, DARREN D.",13-Sep-12,31-Aug-13,Special Emphasis Panel (ZGM1-BRT-1 (CO)),,6950370,"GRAF, JOERG ",Not Applicable,98,Unavailable,72643117,US,38.907152,-77.040287,AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,DC,Unavailable,20036-2904,UNITED STATES, ,13-Sep-12,31-Aug-13,859,Other Research-Related,2012,NIGMS,9000,,9000,

Recent studies suggest that mortality in patients with chronic wounds approaches that seen in some malignancies; and there is an urgent need to identify effective therapies that both improve ultimate wound outcome; and alleviate patient symptoms and suffering. The proposed research will focus on both of these aims; by elucidating critical molecular pathways driving recalcitrant wounds; facilitating translation of these findings to identify clinically predictive biomarkers; and identiying therapeutic targets to improve outcomes and wound related pain.            ,NINR,8413892,31-Jul-12,RFA-NR-12-002,1R01NR013888-01,1,R01,NR,13888,1,,"TULLY, LOIS ",1-Aug-12,31-May-17,Special Emphasis Panel (ZNR1-REV-T (11)),,9633738,"SHANMUGAM, VICTORIA KATE",Not Applicable,98,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,49515844,US,38.904729,-77.016304,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,WASHINGTON,DC,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,20057-0001,UNITED STATES, ,1-Aug-12,31-May-13,361,Research Projects,2012,NINR,269246,132000,401246,

Unfortunately; several large late phase trials of HIV microbicides have failed for unknown reasons; with the research subjects using the microbicides having rates of HIV transmission higher than subjects using placebos. We hypothesize that one factor contributing to the failure of the microbicides is that their use produces a harmful change in the microbial flora living in the vagina; whch leads to inflammation or activation of the cells that HIV replicates in; increasing the risks of HIV transmission. In our study; we propose to use new molecular biological techniques to comprehensively catalog essentially all of the microbes living in the vagina and determine how the use of HIV microbicides alters the population of the microbes. Determining that the use of HIV microbicides lead to a significant; potentially harmful alteration in the population of vaginal flora would help explain the failure of the existing microbicides to prevent HIV transmission and may help enable the development of new; more effect HIV microbicides.,NIAID,8143864,15-Aug-12,,5R33AI079798-05,5,R33,AI,79798,5,,"VERONESE, FULVIA D.",5-Sep-08,31-Aug-14,Special Emphasis Panel (NSS),,1905018,"ZEICHNER, STEVEN L",Not Applicable,98,Unavailable,143983562,US,38.92636,-77.012376,CHILDREN'S RESEARCH INSTITUTE,WASHINGTON,DC,Unavailable,20010-2916,UNITED STATES, ,1-Sep-12,31-Aug-14,855,Research Projects,2012,NIAID,419149,19250,438399,
